  * A RaphtoryGraph is an immutable collection of perspectives over a graph generated for Raphtory that support
  * all graph operations.
  * It implements the operations exposed by GraphOperations returning a new RaphtoryGraph for
  * those operations that have a graph as a result.
  * All the operations executed over a RaphtoryGraph get executed individually over every perspective of the graph in the
  * collection. Graph states refer to the state of ever single perspective in the collection separately.
