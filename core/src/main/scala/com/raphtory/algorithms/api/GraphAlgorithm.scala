/**
  * {s}`GraphAlgorithm`
  *  : Base class for writing graph algorithms
  *
  * ## Attributes
  *
  *  {s}`logger: Logger`
  *    : Logger instance for writing out log messages
  *
  * ## Methods
  *
  *  {s}`apply(graph: GraphPerspective): GraphPerspective`
  *    : Default implementation returns the graph unchanged
  *
  *   {s}`tabularise(graph: GraphPerspective): Table`
  *    : Return tabularised results (default implementation returns empty table)
  *
  *   {s}`run(graph: GraphPerspective): Unit`
  *      : Run graph algorithm and output results (called internally by the query API to execute the algorithm).
  *        Normally, this method should not be overriden. Overriding this method can mean that the algorithm will
  *        behave differently, depending on whether it is called as part of a [](com.raphtory.algorithms.api.Chain)
  *        or on its own.
  *
  *   {s}`->(graphAlgorithm: GraphAlgorithm): Chain`
  *      : Create a new algorithm [](com.raphtory.algorithms.api.Chain) which runs this algorithm first before
  *        running the other algorithm.
  *
  *        {s}`graphAlgorithm: GraphAlgorithm)`
  *          : next algorithm to run in the chain
