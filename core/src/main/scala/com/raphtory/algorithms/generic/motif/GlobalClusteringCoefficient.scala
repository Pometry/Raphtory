/**
  * {s}`GlobalClusteringCoefficient()`
  *  : Returns the two graph-wide clustering coefficients.
  *
  *  The first of these is the average clustering
  *  coefficient, the mean of all node local clustering coefficients. The second of these is the transitivity
  *  which is 3 times the number of triangles divided by the number of wedges, representing the probability that
  *  a randomly chosen wedge is closed as a triangle.
  *
  * ## Returns
  *
  *  | average clustering       | transitivity               |
  *  | ------------------------ | -------------------------- |
  *  | {s}`avgCluster: Double`  | {s}`transitivity: Double`  |
  *
  * ```{note}
  *  Edges here are treated as undirected, so if the underlying network is directed here,
  * 'neighbours' refers to the union of in-neighbours and out-neighbours.
