/**
  * {s} `EdgeFilter(f: (Vertex, State) => Boolean)`
  *   : Filtered view of the graph achieved by retaining edges according to a predicate function {s}`f`
  *
  *   This transforms the graph by keeping only edges for which {s}`f` returns true.
  *   This fits well within a chain of algorithms as a way of pruning the graph: for example, one could first filter out edges
  *   below a certain weight before running a chosen algorithm.
  *
  * ## Parameters
  *
  * {s} `pruneNodes: Boolean=true`
  *   : if this is {s}`true` then vertices which become isolated (have no incoming or outgoing edges)
  *        after this filtering are also removed.
  *
