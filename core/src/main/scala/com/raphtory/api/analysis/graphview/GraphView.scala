/** Core interface for the analysis API.

  * A `GraphView` is an immutable collection of perspectives over a graph generated for Raphtory that supports
  * all graph operations defined in the [[GraphPerspective]].
  * It implements the operations exposed by [[GraphPerspective]] returning a new `GraphView` or [[MultilayerGraphView]] for
  * those operations that have a graph or multilayer graph as a result.
  * All the operations executed over a `GraphView` get executed individually over every perspective of the graph in the
  * collection. Different perspectives in the collection do not share algorithmic state.
