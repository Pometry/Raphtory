/** Public interface for graph operations
  *
  * The `GraphPerspective` is the interface for defining algorithms in Raphtory and records all operations to be
  * applied to a graph as a sequence of steps to execute.
  *
  * Most operations on a `GraphPerspective` return a graph or multilayer
  * graph as a result. To support returning the
  * correct graph type, the `GraphPerspective` has abstract type members
  *
  *  - `Graph`: Current graph type (can be multilayer or reduced)
  *  - `MultilayerGraph`: The type of the [[MultilayerGraphPerspective]] corresponding to the current graph
  *  - `ReducedGraph`: The type of the [[ReducedGraphPerspective]] corresponding to the current graph
