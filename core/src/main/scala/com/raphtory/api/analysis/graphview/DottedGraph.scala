/** Marked timeline view of a [[TemporalGraph]]
  *
  * A DottedGraph is a [[TemporalGraph]] with one or a sequence of temporal epochs across the timeline
  * that can be used as references to create perspectives of the graph.
  * To do so, this class offers methods to look to the past or to the future from every temporal epoch
  * or to create windows that end ([[Alignment.END]]),
  * have its center ([[Alignment.MIDDLE]]),
  * or start ([[Alignment.START]]) at every temporal epoch.
  *
  * When creating a window from a temporal epoch, they are always included within the window.
  * Particularly, for the three alignment options we have, the bounds of the windows are as follows:
  *  - Alignment.START: The start of the window is inclusive and the end exclusive
  *  - Alignment.MIDDLE: The start of the window is inclusive and the end exclusive
  *  - Alignment.END: The start of the window is exclusive and the end inclusive
  *
  *  All the strings expressing intervals need to be in the format <number> <unit> ,
  *  where numbers must be integers and units must be one of
  *  {'year', 'month', 'week', 'day', 'hour', 'min'/'minute', 'sec'/'second', 'milli'/'millisecond'}
  *  using the plural when the number is different than 1.
  *  Commas and the construction 'and' are omitted to allow natural text.
  *  For instance, the interval "1 month 1 week 3 days" can be rewritten as "1 month, 1 week, and 3 days"
  *  @see  [[RaphtoryGraph]], [[TemporalGraph]]
