/**
  * Description
  * LPA returns the communities of the constructed graph as detected by synchronous label propagation.
  *Every vertex is assigned an initial label at random. Looking at the labels of its neighbours, a probability is assigned
  *to observed labels following an increasing function then the vertexâ€™s label is updated with the label with the highest
  *probability. If the new label is the same as the current label, the vertex votes to halt. This process iterates until
  *all vertex labels have converged. The algorithm is synchronous since every vertex updates its label at the same time.
  *
  *Parameters
  *top (Int) : The number of top largest communities to return. (Default: 0) If not specified, Raphtory will return all detected communities.
  *weight (String) : Edge property (Default: ""). To be specified in case of weighted graph.
  *maxIter (Int) : Maximum iterations for algorithm to run. (Default: 500)
  *seed (Long) : Value used for the random selection, can be set to ensure same result is returned per run. If not specified, it will generate a random seed.
  *output (String) : The path where the output will be saved. If not specified, defaults to /tmp/LPA
  *
  *Returns
  *ID (Long) : Vertex ID
  *Label (Long) : The ID of the community this belongs to
  *
  *Notes
  *This implementation of LPA incorporated probabilistic elements which makes it
  *non-deterministic; The returned communities may differ on multiple executions.
  *Which is why you may want to set the seed if testing.
