/**
Description
  Returns outliers detected based on the community structure of the Graph.

  The algorithm assumes that the state of each vertex contains a community label (e.g., set by running LPA on the graph, initially)
  and then defines an outlier score based on a node's
  community membership and how it compares to its neighbors community memberships.

Parameters
  label (String) - Identifier for community label
  cutoff (Double) - Outlier score threshold (default: 0.0). Identifies the outliers with an outlier score > cutoff.
  labeler (Option[GraphAlgorithm]) - Community algorithm to run to get labels (None by default)

Returns
  outliers Map(Long, Double) â€“ Map of (node, outlier score) sorted by their outlier score.
                  Returns `top` nodes with outlier score higher than `cutoff` if specified.
