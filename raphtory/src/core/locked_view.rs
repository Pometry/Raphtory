//! A data structure for sharding a temporal graph.
//!
//! When a raphtory graph is created, the code will automatically shard the graph depending
//! on how many shards you set the graph to originally have when initializing it.
//!
//! For example, Graph::new(4) will create a graph with 4 shards.
//!
//! Each of these shards will be stored in a separate file, and will be loaded into memory when needed.
//!
//! Each shard will have its own set of vertex and edge data, and will be able to be queried independently.
