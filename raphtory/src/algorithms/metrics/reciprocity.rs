//! Reciprocity - measure of the symmetry of relationships in a graph.
//! This calculates the number of reciprocal connections (edges that go in both directions) in a
//! graph and normalizes it by the total number of edges.
//!
//! In a social network context, reciprocity measures the likelihood that if person A is linked
//! to person B, then person B is linked to person A. This algorithm can be used to determine the
//! level of symmetry or balance in a social network. It can also reveal the power dynamics in a
//! group or community_detection. For example, if one person has many connections that are not reciprocated,
//! it could indicate that this person has more power or influence in the network than others.
//!
//! In a business context, reciprocity can be used to study customer behavior. For instance, in a
//! transactional network, if a customer tends to make a purchase from a seller and then the seller
//! makes a purchase from the same customer, it can indicate a strong reciprocal relationship
//! between them. On the other hand, if the seller does not make a purchase from the same customer,
//! it could imply a less reciprocal or more one-sided relationship.
//!
//! There are three algorithms in this module:
//! - `all_local_reciprocity` - returns the reciprocity of every node in the graph as a tuple of
//! vector id and the reciprocity
//! - `global_reciprocity` - returns the global reciprocity of the entire graph
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```rust
//! use raphtory::algorithms::metrics::reciprocity::{all_local_reciprocity, global_reciprocity};
//! use raphtory::prelude::*;
//! let g = Graph::new();
//! let vs = vec![
//!     (1, 1, 2),
//!     (1, 1, 4),
//!     (1, 2, 3),
//!     (1, 3, 2),
//!     (1, 3, 1),
//!     (1, 4, 3),
//!     (1, 4, 1),
//!     (1, 1, 5),
//! ];
//!
//! for (t, src, dst) in &vs {
//!     g.add_edge(*t, *src, *dst, NO_PROPS, None).unwrap();
//! }
//!
//! println!("all_local_reciprocity: {:?}", all_local_reciprocity(&g));
//! println!("global_reciprocity: {:?}", global_reciprocity(&g));
//! ```
