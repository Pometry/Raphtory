# Benchmarks

This is the raphtory benchmarking suite. 
It is designed to test the performance of raphtory against other graph processing systems.

Systems currently supported are:
- [raphtory](https://github.com/Pometry/Raphtory)
- [neo4j](https://neo4j.com/)
- [graph-tool](https://graph-tool.skewed.de/)
- [networkx](https://networkx.org/)
- [kuzu](https://kuzudb.com)
- [memgraph](https://memgraph.com/)
- [cozodb](https://github.com/cozodb/cozo)

All benchmarks are run in docker, this documentation ONLY supports docker.
They can be run outside of docker, however this requires you to install all the systems yourself.

These benchmarks run using a slim version of the pokec dataset, which is a social network dataset. 
More information available [here](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-pokec.html)

# Requirements

- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- python 3.10
    - python libraries
      - docker
      - requests
      - tqdm
      - pandas
      - raphtory
      - neo4j
      - 

# How to run

1. First download the pokec dataset, this can be done by running below. 
This will download the dataset into a folder called 'data'


    python benchmark_driver.py -b download

2. Benchmarks can be run by running the below command with a benchmark name


    python benchmark_driver.py -b <benchmark_name>

Supported benchmark names are:

- `all` Run All 
- `download` Download Data 
- `r` Run Raphtory Benchmark 
- `gt` Run GraphTool Benchmark 
- `k` Run Kuzu Benchmark 
- `nx` Run NetworkX Benchmark 
- `neo` Run Neo4j Benchmark 
- `mem` Run Memgraph Benchmark 
- `cozo` Run CozoDB Benchmark
