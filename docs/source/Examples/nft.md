# What's Awash With NFTs: Finding Suspicious Trading Cycles

## Overview

In this example we will use Raphtory to find users that have been trading NFTs in cycles. At the end of this example, you will have been able to: 
- read a CSV into raphtory bipartite graph
- run the cycle detection algorithm
- analyse the results to find a list of traders suspiciously trading NFTs

The example is presented in both in Scala and Python.
This is the code used to obtain the insights from the Raphtory [NFT blogpost](raphtory.com/nfts/) .

## Pre-requisites

Follow our Installation guide: [Scala](../Install/scala/install.md) or [Python (with Conda)](../Install/python/install_conda.md), [Python (without Conda)](../Install/python/install_no_conda.md).

## Background

A Non-fungible Token (NFT) is a digital asset which cannot be copied, substituted, or subdivided, meaning it is wholly unique.

![title](http://web.archive.org/web/20220328080727im_/https://blog.portion.io/content/images/2021/07/Kevin-McCoy-Quantum.gif)

NFTâ€™s are stored on blockchain systems, notably Ethereum, with the owner of an NFT being whomever has access to the wallet it is stored within.

Since the first NFT, Quantum (shown above), many new NFT artworks have arisen including Cryptokitties and Cryptopunks. This culminated in a boom in 2021 which included the arrival of the Bored Ape Yacht Club, with NFTS reaching a global market valued of $15.7 Billion.

### Set your tokens to spun

With such large amounts moving around in a seemingly unregulated market this has naturally attracted criminals looking to get in on the action. For instance, a recent crime report from [Chainalysis](https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2022-crypto-crime-report-preview-nft-wash-trading-money-laundering/) revealed that 262 users have been participating in wash-trading their NFTs.

A wash-trade occurs when the buyer and seller within a transaction are the same person or group of people. This is normally done to mislead potential buyers into thinking the asset is worth more, by pumping up the price with each trade, or to make them believe it has very high liquidity, i.e., if they buy it, it can be quickly sold at any point in the future. In reality when they do buy it, they find they cannot sell it to anyone for remotely close to the price they purchased it for. 

The authorities have been hot on the heels of NFT crime, where just last month a former NFT marketplace employee was charged with the [first case of digital asset insider trading](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/former-employee-nft-marketplace-charged-first-ever-digital-asset-insider-trading-scheme). This won't stop criminals from attempting to make money off NFT's, but it will force them to attempt to better obscure their activities. 

This got us thinking. Network of transactions... occurring over time... complex patterns hidden in large volumes of data... if only we had a tool to let us investigate further :thinking:! Fortunately, Raphtory was at hand to let us dive into the problem. 

### What are we digging into?

With the above premise in mind, we set out to see what sort of patterns we could find within the network of trades, specifically focusing on `cycles`. This is when a NFT has been sold by a wallet, but eventually ends up being owned by it again. This can involve a chain of any number of other wallets, take any amount of time, and increase or decrease the price by any amount.

Below we can see an example of such a cycle where `Wallet A` sold an NFT to `Wallet B` for `$50` on Monday, but its back in their position by Thursday, costing them `$750`. They either have serious sellers remorse or, more likely, the same person owns all these wallets and is trying to pump up the price of the given NFT.

![](https://www.raphtory.com/images/nfts/NFT_Cycle.png)
*Example NFT cycle across 5 wallets over the course of a week*

This example opens many initial questions about the network which we will explore, such as: 
* Do users regularly cycle NFTs between each other? And if so, is cycling localised to a small number of wallets or is the practice widespread?
* What is the timespan over which these normally take place?
* Can we actually see typical washing practices like `pumping` in action? 

### We have our tools, where's the data?

To answer these questions we used open data from the ["Mapping the NFT revolution: market trends, trade networks, and visual features"](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-00053-8) paper.
This dataset contains 4.7 million NFTs that in total were traded across 6.1 million transactions between June 23, 2017, and April 27, 2021. The data we used in in this tutorial is a cleaned and trimmed version.

### Modelling the data 

Prior research has analysed this data as a network of wallets, however, we took a different approach. 
We created a `bipartite graph`, meaning a graph with two types of nodes, corresponding to wallets (addresses) and NFTs. Directed edges $Wallet\rightarrow NFT$ in this network indicate a purchase. 

From the perspective of an individual NFT within this model we can see all the wallets which have purchased it, when these occurred and for how much. With this information it is trivial to rebuild cycles of any length. 

Below is an example of a bipartite graph. On the left we have Ethereum wallets, the right NFTs, and the edges indicating who has purchased what. Some of these transactions (in green) appear to be innocuous, whereas others (in red) are part of a cycle to pump the value of `NFT B`.  

Digging into this we can see that there is a wallet cycle $A\rightarrow B\rightarrow C\rightarrow A$ over the course of 4 blocks, pumping the price from 0.8ETH to 2.6ETH.

![](https://www.raphtory.com/images/nfts/buy_nft.png)
*Example of an NFT Bipartite Graph. Red arrows indicate the transaction is part of a cycle, green arrows indicate the transaction is not.*

#### Why do we model the data like this? 

Cycle detection is a notoriously hard algorithm to run on large networks because you need to track the entire path you have traversed so far. This explodes exponentially with the size of the cycle you are looking for, quickly becoming impossible to calculate. This would be the case if we had to follow each NFT along the transaction edges in a network of wallets. 

By instead splitting the NFT's into their own set of nodes (as above) we have all the information on the transactions each has been involved in within the edge lists of the NFT vertex. With Raphtory's time-focused API's we can easily order all the edges chronologically and then loop through them to find all cycles. This means even if there are cycles involving thousands of transactions/wallets, they are just as easy to detect as triangles.


## Data

Data for this code can be found at the [OSF.IO here](https://osf.io/32zec/). 

The data consists of

1. `Data_API_reduced.csv` - A CSV file containing the Ethereum Transactions of NFT sales. Download and extract this file.

The data is pre-classified and contains transaction details for NFT sales including the buyers, sellers, type of NFT, price and time. The sales are spread across various tokens and cryptocurrencies, however, in some cases the price data in USD was unavailable. To handle this, we filtered the data to those traded with Ethereum where we could obtain the average $ Dollar \rightarrow Ether$ price for the day of the trade. This left us with 2.3 million trades across 3,384 NFTs, an example row of which can be seen below. 

```
| Smart_contract | ID_token | Transaction_hash | Seller_address | Seller_username | Buyer_address | Buyer_username | Price_Crypto | Crypto | Price_USD | Collection       | Market   | Datetime_updated_seconds | Collection_cleaned | Category    |
| 0xd73be..      | 66733    | 0xcdb2c..        | 0xd0c23..      | GorillaNixon    | 0xf6362..     | iMott          | 0.008        | ETH    | 15.4833   | Blockchaincuties | OpenSea  | 2021-04-01 00:05:09      | Block              | Collectible |
```


2. `ETH-USD.csv` - Price of Ethereum/USD pair per day
3. `results.json` - Final results after running the code 

The code should automatically download files `1` and `2`.


## Code Overview

There are two ways to run this example, via scala and python.

At present the scala code is highly optimised runs in less than 10 seconds.

### Scala

`src/main/scala/` contains the bulk of the code used in Raphtory

- `LocalRunner.scala` runs the example. This initialises and executes the components (FileSpout, GraphBuilder and Algorithm )
    - Runs a FileSpout (reads the Ethereum data from the above CSV file)
    - Executes the `cyclemania` algorithm
    - Saves the result to a `.json` file in the `/tmp/` folder
- `analysis/CycleMania.scala` the cycle detection algorithm

### Python

`src/main/python` contains
- `nft_analysis.ipynb` this is an interactive jupyter notebook running the same process as above,
  except all the code is written completely in Python. In addition, this notebook also explores the data
  and we find a numerous of wallets suspiciously trading NFTs between each other.
- `nft_helper.py` are some helper functions containing code to load our results, draw graphs and read the data file.

Please read the notebook for more information or follow the guide in the docs.

### Executing the cycle detection algorithm 

Now we execute our cycle detection algorithm. 

We will run the algorithm at the latest point in time, which we have to manually set. 

For each NFT our algorithm will: 

- For each time it was purchased, checks the list of purchases to see if a user re-bought the NFT at a later date, at a higher price

This all happens within the step function. A step is executed once on each node.

The code has been optimised to O(n) complexity.
