   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

.. warning::
   This is the documentation for Raphtory 0.5.0-alpha. In this version Raphtory has been completely rebuilt to run on top of `Apache Pulsar <https://pulsar.apache.org>`_, moving away from Akka. This has fixed a number of issues faced in prior versions, notably around message back pressure, and introduces many exciting features which are discussed throughout these pages. 
   
   0.5.0 is very usable, however, it is still an alpha version being actively developed. If you notice any issues or have feature suggestions please raise an issue or come and discuss it with us on `Slack <https://join.slack.com/t/raphtory/shared_invite/zt-xbebws9j-VgPIFRleJFJBwmpf81tvxA>`_.

Documentation Overview
======================

Raphtory is an open-source platform for distributed real-time temporal graph analytics, allowing you to load and
process large dynamic datasets across time. Raphtory is funded in part by
`The Alan Turing Institute <https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/raphtory-practical-system-analysis-dynamic-graphs>`_
and built by `Pometry <http://pometry.com>`_, The `QMUL Networks Group  <http://networks.eecs.qmul.ac.uk>`_ and a host of wonderful independent contributors.

If you would like a brief summary of what its used for before fully diving into the getting start guide please check
