Documentation Overview
======================

Raphtory is an open-source platform for distributed real-time temporal graph analytics, allowing you to load and
process large dynamic datasets across time. Raphtory is funded in part by
`The Alan Turing Institute <https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/raphtory-practical-system-analysis-dynamic-graphs>`_
and built by `Pometry <http://pometry.com>`_, The `QMUL Networks Group  <http://networks.eecs.qmul.ac.uk>`_ and a host of wonderful independent contributors.

If you would like a brief summary of what its used for before fully diving into the getting start guide please check
