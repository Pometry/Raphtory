Documentation Overview
======================

Raphtory is an open-source platform for distributed real-time temporal graph analytics, allowing you to load and process large dynamic datasets across time. Raphtory is funded in part by `The Alan Turing Institute <https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/raphtory-practical-system-analysis-dynamic-graphs>`_ and built by `Pometry <http://pometry.com>`_, The `QMUL Networks Group  <http://networks.eecs.qmul.ac.uk>`_ and a host of wonderful independent contributors.

If you would like a brief summary of what it's used for before fully diving into the getting start guide please check out our latest talks and blogs on the `Raphtory website <https://raphtory.com>`_.

You can try PyRaphtory (the python library) right now in a Jupyter notebook within your browser, no install is required.  
`Click here to launch the notebook <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Raphtory/Raphtory/v0.2.0a9?labpath=examples%2Fbinder_python%2Findex.ipynb>`_.

Alternatively, hit next and lets get Raphtory :doc:`installed <Install/python/pyraphtory>`. If you want to dive headfirst into the API's you can visit the :doc:`PythonDocs <PythonDocs/index>` or :doc:`ScalaDocs <Scaladoc/index>`.
