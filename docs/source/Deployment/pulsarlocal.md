# Raphtory Streaming and Apache Pulsar

## Installing Apache Pulsar
As of 0.5.0 Raphtory has moved away from Akka and now uses [Apache Pulsar](https://pulsar.apache.org) as its message broker to support communication between its distributed components. Using Pulsar means that all data sent within Raphtory is fully backed up and communication can easily scale to millions of messages a second. Pulsar also provides connectors to every conceivable source of data which can be used to pull data into Raphtory when building graphs.

For any running instance of Raphtory, even local, we need to be able to connect to a Pulsar cluster. Fortunately, Pulsar comes with a standalone mode which packages everything together to be run once installed.  Pulsar can be installed in a variety of ways, which can be seen below. We have, however, create a [install script](../Deployment/pulsarlocal.md) which will automatically manage this for you, if you prefer.

### Downloading Natively
The simplest way of getting Pulsar is to download it from the Apache archive and unzip the tar. 

```bash
wget https://archive.apache.org/dist/pulsar/pulsar-2.9.0/apache-pulsar-2.9.0-bin.tar.gz 
tar -xzf apache-pulsar-2.9.0-bin.tar.gz
```

Once done, you may `cd` into the Pulsar directory and run the executable in standalone mode. This will launch Apache Zookeeper, Bookkeeper and Pulsar in one service and provide everything we need to run Raphtory.

```bash
cd apache-pulsar-2.9.0
bin/pulsar standalone
```

### Running in Docker
The alternative way of running Pulsar is to do so inside a virtual environment, the easiest to use being [Docker](https://www.docker.com). **Note:** For Mac users with the new M1 chips, this is currently the only way of running Pulsar. 

The simplest way to install Docker is to use the [Desktop client](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) which is available for Mac, Linux and Windows. Once you have downloaded and installed Docker Desktop it will start up and you will be presented with a dashboard which shows you currently have no `containers` (services) running:

<p align="center">
	<img src="../_static/install/dockerdesktop.png" width="80%" alt="Sdk Man java lists"/>
</p>

Lets now run a container for Pulsar:

```
docker run -it \ 
-p 6650:6650 \
-p 8080:8080 \
-p 2181:2181 \
-v $PWD/data:/pulsar/data \
apachepulsar/pulsar:2.9.0 \
bin/pulsar standalone
```

Here we run the docker container in an interactive mode `run -it` where we attach to the service and can see the output. We bind the ports for Zookeeper and Pulsar to our localhost, so that Raphtory can communicate with the service. We create a volume called `data` in the current working directory which will contain everything written into Pulsar `$PWD/data:/pulsar/data`. Finally we give the docker image (which contains all the code) `apachepulsar/pulsar:2.9.0` and tell it to run the same command as if we run it natively (`bin/pulsar standalone`).

### What it should look like
Pulsar standalone produces _A LOT_ of output, which can almost exclusively be ignored. It will take about a minute to start up and you will know when this is completed as it stops outputting and prints a block of JSON telling you its address.

</p>

If you run Pulsar in Docker, you will now be able to see your container in the dashboard, which is given a random name, for example, mine was called wonderful_fermat.

	<img src="../_static/install/dockerrunning.png" width="80%" alt="Sdk Man java lists"/>
</p>

**Note** If you have any issues with Pulsar (errors etc.) the quickest solution is often to delete the data folder and allow it to restart from scratch. This won't affect Raphtory as most data is recreated on new runs anyway. 


## Script options
- You can replace /usr/local/bin with the install path you would like.
- You can replace 2.9.0 with another pulsar version if you require another version.
- If you are missing dependencies, the script will report what is missing
- If you wish to know more about the script options run `./bin/pulsar-local`

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Checkout the Raphtory code base | `git clone URL && cd Raphtory`|
|Install binaries | `./bin/pulsar-local -d machine -a install -v 2.9.0 -p /usr/local/bin`|
|Install pulsar connectors | `./bin/pulsar-local -d machine -a install-connectors -v 2.9.0 -p /usr/local/bin`|
|Start pulsar | `./bin/pulsar-local -d machine -a start -v 2.9.0 -p /usr/local/bin`|
|Stop pulsar | `./bin/pulsar-local -d machine -a stop -v 2.9.0`|

<br>

## Running Pulsar locally using docker
|   |   |
|---|---|
|Checkout the Raphtory code base | `git clone URL && cd Raphtory`|
|Start pulsar docker container |`./bin/pulsar-local -d docker -a start -v 2.9.0`|
|Stop pulsar docker container |`./bin/pulsar-local -d docker -a stop -v 2.9.0`|
|Get pulsar docker container logs | `./bin/pulsar-local -d docker -a logs -v 2.9.0`|

## Running Pulsar locally using minikube (must have existing minikube cluster)
|   |   |
|---|---|
|Checkout the Raphtory code base | `git clone URL && cd Raphtory`|
|Get kube context of your existing cluster | `kubectl config get-contexts -o name`|
|To start pulsar on minikube | `./bin/pulsar-local -d minikube -a start -v 2.9.0 -m <minikube_context_name>`|
|To stop running pulsar deployment on minikube | `./bin/pulsar-local -d minikube -a start -v 2.9.0 -m <minikube_context_name>`|
