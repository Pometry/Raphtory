# AverageNeighbourDegree

{s}`AverageNeighbourDegree()`
 : Compute the average degree of a vertex's neighbours

 ```{note}
 This algorithm treats the network as undirected.
 ```

## States

 {s}`avgNeighbourDegree: Double`
   : Average degree of the vertex's neighbours

## Returns

 | vertex name       | average neighbour degree     |
 | ----------------- | ---------------------------- |
 | {s}`name: String` | `avgNeighbourDegree: Double` |
