If we set up a spout from a streaming source which continues to ingest data, Raphtory will continue to create a new `windowed perspective` every day as the new information arrives.\n",
    "\n",
    "As can be seen in the example, the process to create perspectives has two steps. The first of these is setting the times you are interested in, which can be a singular point (using `at()`) or, alternatively, a sequence of points with a given increment. For sequences, four different methods are available:\n",

For instance, the perspective for `Dec 27, 2019` to `Jan 2, 2020` has a small amount of data inside of the slice which can be analysed.
