    "As we have seen in the ingestion tutorial, functions can be submitted to a graph and a dataframe returned. However, this is just scratching the surface of what is possible in Raphtory. In this tutorial we will go through all of the different ways the graph and its history can be manipulated to produce exciting new insights about your data.\n",

    "When running queries in Raphtory we have five steps which may be undertaken depending on your desired output, all of which we will cover in this tutorial. In order of execution these are: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Filtering the timeline to the segment you are interested in. All updates/history outside of this will be ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Choosing a point, or set of points in time at which to view the graph. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Choosing which direction (`past` or `future`) to look in at these points or apply a set of windows. This along with point 2 creates our `Perspectives`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Apply a sequence of graph operations/algorithms that end with a `select()`. Followed by a sequence of table operations to get a result for your query.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Finally, either write your result to a `sink`, saving it for later processing, or return it as a dataframe to be used straightaway. \n",
    "\n",
    "Stages 1-4 are `lazy` operations, meaning computation inside Raphtory is only kicked off once you have chosen an output format in step 5. A conceptual example of the stages for creating perspectives from a temporal graph is depicted below.\n",

    "* Finally we apply our windows, setting the alignment to the `end()` i.e. looking into the past. This is the default, but is present to show what it would look like if you wanted to use one of the other options.\n",

    "For each window we filter the results and group the out degree per timestamp, plotting to our figure. The output dataframe and figure have some interesting results which are worth quickly touching on. Firstly, even though we specified the range starts at line 0, we only start to see results from line 6000. This is because at all prior timepoints (0-5000) there was no data present and, therefore, no rows returned. \n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, within the plot we can see the smaller windows (100 and 1000) appear to stop within the bounds of the timeline filters by the larger windows do not. This is because Raphtory allows for perspectives to run at any timepoint, but will only include the data within the set timeline filters. \n",
    "\n",

    "* For the 100,000 size window, which includes everything as the window is larger than the whole history, this flatlines from 20,000 as it doesn't lose any data, but nothing new can be gained.\n",

Raphtory takes care of this by providing a simple set of increment primitives which can be utilised on their own or together in human readable strings for both window sets and time ranges. \n",

Below we are using these for both a list of windows and for setting the increment on a `walk()` across the full history of our dataset. You will notice that most of the windows are fairly simple, but the last one is quite complex. This is to demonstrate the use of commas and `and` within the increment to make it more readable.\n",

    "Once we have defined the set of perspectives we want to work with, we may also want to define several algorithms to run across all of them. \n",
    "\n",
    "While the `.execute()` function returns a `Table`, graphs also have the function `transform()` which will apply an algorithm, but return the graph back with algorithmic state stored as a property. These can, therefore, be chained together to build as complex a pipeline as you like!\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to using already defined graph algorithms (as we have done so far), you can also apply operations directly to the graph object. This is especially useful when you want to pre-process the graph before applying an already defined algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "To give an example of both of these elements, in the code below we:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a set of perspectives via `depart` with two windows applied to each timepoint.\n",
    "* Run both the PageRank and Connected Components algorithms. \n",
    "* Filter the graph for vertices with an out degree greater than 10.\n",
    "* Execute the `NodeList` algorithm which takes a list of properties you which to return.\n",
    "* Set the query running by requesting the dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, we can see in the final result that before line 8000 the only character with which passes our filter is Frodo, and there are very few characters which make it in at all! Note, when filtering vertices, if a vertex is to be removed so will ALL of its edges. This means they will no longer be available to the vertex attached on the other side. \n"

    "\n",
    "To finish up we can look at the case where we want to either store our output for later use, or to push it downstream when Raphtory is being used as part of an ETL pipeline. To do this, instead of calling `to_df()`, we call `write_to(location)`, replacing location with where we want the data to be sent to. \n",
