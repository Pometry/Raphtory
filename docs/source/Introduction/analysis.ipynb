    "({scaladoc}`com.raphtory.api.analysis.graphview.GraphPerspective`) of the graph for both cases:\n",

    "In addition, you have access to two more methods: `from` and `to`.\n",
    "The table below provides a quick summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Function            | Activity kept                          |\n",
    "|---------------------|----------------------------------------|\n",
    "| `from(start)`       | everything after `start` (inclusive)   |\n",

    "| `slice(start, end)` | equivalent to `from(start).until(end)` |\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are working with real times, then you can also provide strings expressing timestamps. The default format is `\"yyyy-MM-dd[ HH:mm:ss[.SSS]]\"`. \n",
    "This means that you can provide just dates (`\"2020-01-01\"`), or timestamps with up to seconds (`\"2020-01-01 00:00:00\"`) or up to milliseconds (`\"2020-01-01 00:00:00.000\"`). **Note:** These examples are interpreted as having all trailing units as zeros.\n",

    "## Creating perspectives\n",
    "\n",
    "We have only executed algorithms over monolithic views of graphs so far. However, the nice part about Raphtory is that you can run them over sequences of perspectives to discover dynamic changes.\n",
    "A quick example to do so is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{literalinclude} ../../../doc-tests/src/test/scala/Queries.scala\n",
    ":language: scala\n",
    ":start-after: \"[depart-window]\"\n",
    ":end-before: \"[depart-window]\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, starting from January 1 2020 we move forward one day at a time, looking forward over the next day of data. At each of these stopping points (`perspectives`) we execute the algorithm and write the results to the file. If we set up a spout from a streaming source which continues to ingest data, Raphtory will continue to create a new `windowed perspective` every day as the new information arrives.\n",
    "\n",
    "As can be seen in the example, the process to create perspectives has two steps. The first of these is setting the times you are interested in, which can be a singular point (using `at()`) or, alternatively, a sequence of points with a given increment. For sequences, four different methods are available:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Function            | Effect                                            |\n",
    "|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| `depart(time,increment)`   | Set the start time and increment           |\n",
    "| `climb(time,increment)`    | Set the end time and increment             |\n",
    "| `range(start,end,increment`| Set the start time, end time and increment |\n",
    "| `walk(increment)`          | Set only the increment                     |\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note} \n",
    "If no start and end time are provided, Raphtory will default to the minimum and maximum times in the data (or min and max of the time range if a `slice()` etc. has been applied).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The second step is to specify which direction we are looking in at each time point, for which we have three options. We can look to the `past`, to the `future`, or set a `window`. In the third case, we can align the time point as: \n",
    "\n",
    "* The `Start` of the window - looking into the future the set amount of time. This is the default.\n",
    "* The `End` of the window - looking into the past the set amount of time. \n",
    "* The `Middle` of the window - including data from half the time in both the past and future, providing a smoothing effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note} \n",
    " You can refer to the {scaladoc}`com.raphtory.api.analysis.graphview.DottedGraph` documentation for further details.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Coming back to our first example, we can execute a `walk` along a year of data with increments of one day, and a window of one week into the future as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{literalinclude} ../../../doc-tests/src/test/scala/Queries.scala\n",
    ":language: scala\n",
    ":start-after: \"[walk-window]\"\n",
    ":end-before: \"[walk-window]\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `walk` function doesn't take a start or end time as it explores all available perspectives (given the other filters applied). For the above instance this generates a sequence of perspectives where the first contains data between `Dec 26, 2019` to `Jan 1, 2020`, the second one from `Dec 27, 2019` to `Jan 2, 2020`, etc. The last perspective of the sequence is then going to be from `Dec 31, 2020` to `Jan 6, 2021`. \n",
    "\n",
    "```{note} \n",
    "The reason dates outside of the `.slice(\"2020-01-01\", \"2021-01-01\")` appear in this sequence is because Raphtory includes `partial windows` i.e. where only part of the perspectives time range is inside of the slice. For instance, the perspective for `Dec 27, 2019` to `Jan 2, 2020` has a small amount of data inside of the slice which can be analysed. An example of these partial windows can be seen in the bottom left of the diagram at the top of the page.  \n",
