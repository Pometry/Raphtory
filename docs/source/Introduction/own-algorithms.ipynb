    "# Implementing your own algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous tutorial we looked at the algorithms within the standard Raphtory library and the different ways we can apply them to a graph. While we have also written some simple custom functions, here we're going to go over how to write a new multi-step algorithm. This example algorithm will calculate the _degrees of separation_ from one a character to every other, defaulting to `Gandalf`. \n",
    "\n",
    "As background: [Six degrees of separation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_separation) is \"the idea that all people on average are six, or fewer, social connections away from each other.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## How analysis works in Raphtory\n",
    "\n",
    "Raphtory’s analysis engine is based on __vertex centric computation__  where algorithms are executed in [bulk synchronous parallel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulk_synchronous_parallel) `supersteps`. Within each superstep all vertices complete a function, within which they may execute any of the follow `GAS` operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Gather__: Receive information sent from other nodes in the graph (normally neighbouring nodes).\n",
    "* __Apply__:  Calculate some new state and store these values.\n",
    "* __Scatter__: Send this state to neighbours to be used in the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "While Raphtory does have APIs for global aggregation and histograms, individual vertices have limited knowledge of the graph and must converge to their final state over several supersteps. Each vertex knows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Its own update history, property set and property history e.g. values and update times.\n",
    "* The history/properties of the edges attached to it - both incoming and outgoing. \n",
    "* Its own algorithmic state - this is a map of temporary values that can be set and modified during analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing algorithms in this manner allows them to be run on both your laptop and a cluster without requiring any change. Let's see how it looks to implement the proposed __Degree Separation__ algorithm in this format.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin first import pyraphtory, create a local context and ingest the Lord of The Rings data into a graph."

    "## Algorithm Structure\n",
    "Now that we have the graph set up we can create a new algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithms are classes which extend `PyAlgorithm`. This class has two functions to implement, `__call__()` and `tabularise()`: \n",
    "\n",
    "* \\_\\_call\\_\\_ is where we will be doing the majority of our computation. This takes a `TemporalGraph` and applies a set of operations to it (the functions we will define) and returns a new `TemporalGraph`. \n",
    "* tabularise is where we will choose what data on our vertices to return. This takes a `TemporalGraph` and returns a `Table` which can either be turned into a dataframe or output to a `Sink`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will implement both as we want to compute a new property and output the results, but in many instances we may only need one or the other. For instance, we chained multiple algorithms together in the last tutorial by only applying the \\_\\_call\\_\\_ functions of each algorithm. No tabularise was then required as we finished off with our own call to `select` (returning a `Table`).    \n",
    "\n",
    "### \\_\\_call\\_\\_()\n",
    "There are many functions which may be called on the `TemporalGraph` to build algorithms as complex as you like; these can be found in the PythonDocs on the left. The main two of these are `step()` and `iterate()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* step takes a function which will execute on all vertices once. This is normally to set up an algorithm or called in succession when you have a known number of steps to complete an algorithm.\n",
    "* iterate takes a function which will be applied on vertices until some convergence state is met. This is normally used for the bulk of an algorithm when the number of required steps is unknown. \n",
    "    * This function also requires the user to set a maximum number of steps (to bound the computation) and to decide if all vertices need to execute every superstep or if only messaged vertices are required to, minimising wasted cycles. \n",
    "\n",
    "### tabularise()\n",
    "As tabularise receives a TemporalGraph we can continue calling the same functions here, however, be aware that these won't be applied if you use this algorithm in a chain or run your own `select`. Once you have called select, as we have seen before, we can apply several `Table` steps, such as `filter`, before returning our data in the desired format.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Degree Separation from 10,000ft\n",
    "For our algorithm we want to take these building blocks and set it up such that we start at Gandalf who will tell all of his neighbours they are 1 hop away.\n",
    "These nodes should then message all their neighbours telling them they are 2 hops away, and so on until no more nodes can be reached. Importantly, nodes should only update their state once, as we want the lowest number of hops. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lets take a look at an example implementation of this algorithm, we can then go through what is happening step by step. "
