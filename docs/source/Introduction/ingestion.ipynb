These functions, however, have several optional arguments allowing us to add `properties` and `types` on top of the base structure. Raphtory also allows for a secondary time index for disambiguating event ordering, this defaults to the number of prior updates sent +1.\n",

    "\n",
    "One cool thing about Raphtory is that we can freely insert new information at any point in time and it will be automatically inserted in chronological order. This makes it really easy to merge datasets or ingest out of order data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Raphtory currently support several types of `mutable` properties which can change throughout the lifetime of a vertex or edge, giving them a history to be explored. We also allow the user to specify `immutable` properties which only have one value, useful for meta data and saving memory! All property objects require the user to specify a name and value. The current supported properties include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `MutableString()`\n",
    "* `MutableLong()`\n",
    "* `MutableDouble()`\n",
    "* `MutableBoolean()`\n",
    "* `ImmutableString()` \n",
    "\n",
    "To explore this and to add some properties to our graph, lets load our second dataset!\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we are opening our property file the same way as the structure file. As we don't have any time to work with in this data we will have to create some of our own. We have two options, we can say it all happens at time `1` or we can use the results of our **earliest appearance** query to decide when to insert the properties. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the latter we have zipped the `name` and `earliest_timestamp` columns from our dataframe and turned them into a `dict` where we can look up the best timestamps for each character.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each line we then:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Get the name and look it up in our dict to get the timestamp.\n",
    "* Get the race and gender from the data and wrap them in an `ImmutableString` - they are unchanging metadata, so no need to maintain a history.\n",
    "* Call `add_vertex` passing all of this information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now it's worthwhile noting that we aren't calling a function called `update_vertex` or something similar, even though we know the vertex exists. This is because everything is considered an addition into the history and Raphtory sorts all the ordering internally!"

A perfect example of this is for querying an SQL database and converting the output into a graph. Instead of wrangling with different connectors, structures and return types we provide the `SqlEdgeSource` and `SqlVertexSource` which require only basic connection information, an SQL query and what the returned columns map to. \n",

    "Firstly, in order to connect to it, we need to create a `SqliteConnection` so Raphtory knows how to access the data. In this case, the only thing we need to provide is the path to the file. If we were to use another database instead, such as Postgres, we would use a `PostgresConnection` and provide the hostname, port, etc.\n",

    "With the connection defined, we give our query (selecting all columns) to an `SqlEdgeSource` along with the name of the columns we want to use for the source/target IDs and the timestamp. We could additionally provide column names for types or properties if required. **Note:** This Source will handle conversion between Datetime and Epochs for the timestamps, Integer/Strings for the IDs and all data types for the properties. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we don't have any additional information for the vertices in this file we do not need to use an `SqlVertexSource`, the vertex additions will be automatically generated. If we wanted to add in the properties via a different table/database it would simply require an additional call to `sql_graph.load()` providing a second SQL query. "

The graph here is the same class that we have been using to add updates individually, so the functions are exactly the same.
