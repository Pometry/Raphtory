    "\n",
    "Inserting updates one by one works for small datasets like this Lord of The Rings graph, but it isn't the most efficient way to parse your data. To enable you to work with large datasets we provide the `Source` API. `Sources` let you define where to pull data from and how to convert each tuple into `graph updates`. Raphtory can then handle batching and other speed-ups internally.  \n",
    "\n",
    "`Sources` take two arguments:\n",
    " \n",
    " * A `Spout` - which defines the location of the data.\n",
    " * A `GraphBuilder` - which contains your parsing function. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will come onto custom builders in a second, as if your data exists in a standard graph format, there is a good chance Raphtory already has one defined! For instance, the `lotr.csv` file we used above is in an `edge list` format, so we may use the `CSVEdgeListSource`. This particular source will parse each line as two `vertex additions` and an `edge addition` at the given timestamp. By default the timestamp is assumed to be at the end of the line, but this can be changed via arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the below code we:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a new graph called `edge_list_graph`. \n",
    "* Create a `FileSpout`, giving it the `structure_file`. \n",
    "* Create the `CSVEdgeListSource` and hand it the `FileSpout` which it will use to pull the data.\n",
    "* Connect the source to the graph by calling the `load()` function.\n",
    "* Check the `Source` has ingested the data by running our **earliest appearence** query. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth noting here:\n",
    "\n",
    "* We can pass the `FileSpout` several more advanced options such as a directory of files, a filepath Regex etc. and it will pull in all files which match. \n",
    "* `load()` can be called as many times as you like on the graph with difference spouts and builders, allowing you to merge data from multiple sources.\n"

The graph here is the same class that we have been using to add updates indivudally, so the functions are exactly the same. The `tuple` is a singular piece of data which is going to be output from the `Spout`. In our case the spout is going to produce strings, one for each line in the file we give it.\n",
