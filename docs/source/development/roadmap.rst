As an open-source project, our project roadmap is public and open to
suggestions. We welcome your feedback and contributions to the project.

We work in 2-week sprints, and our roadmap is organized by sprint on Github.
View the current sprint and the next sprint on our `Github project`_

Each sprint is organized by issues, which are organized by priority in our fortnightly sprint planning meetings.
These are assigned to team members, and tracked on the Github project board, completed upon merging a pull request.
