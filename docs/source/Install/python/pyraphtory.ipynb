    "\n",
    "As Raphtory is focused on dynamic and temporal analysis, all events in the graph's history  (adding, updating or deleting nodes/edges) must happen at a given time. This can all be at the same time (if, for example, you are working with snapshots) but we still need a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, when we add a vertex we have two arguments: the `timestamp` and the `vertex ID`. Simiarly, when adding an edge, we have three arguments: the `timestamp`, the `source vertex` and the `destination vertex`. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** All graphs are directed by default in Raphtory, but can be `projected` into an undirected graph - we will go indepth into graph projections later in the tutorial.   \n",

From this point we can either write our results to a `Sink` (file, database, etc.), which we will cover later in the tutorial, or convert it into a dataframe for further analysis.\n",
