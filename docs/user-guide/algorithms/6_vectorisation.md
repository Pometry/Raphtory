# Vectorisation

The [vectors][raphtory.vectors] module allows you to transform a graph into a collection of documents and vectorise those documents using an embedding function.

Using this you can perform [semantic search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_search) over your graph data and build powerful AI systems with graph based RAG.
