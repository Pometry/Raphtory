# Running algorithms 

Raphtory implements many of the standard algorithms you expect within a graph library, but also has several temporal algorithms such as `Temporal Reachability` and `Temporal Motifs`. 

Raphtory categorizes algorithms into `graphwide` and `node centric` algorithms.

- `graphwide`: returns one value for the whole graph. 

- `node centric`: returns one value for each node in the graph

For these examples we are going to use the [One graph to rule them all](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07871) dataset, which maps the co-occurrence of characters in the Lord of The Rings books. 

This dataset is a simple edge list, consisting of the source character, destination character and the sentence they occurred together in (which we use as a timestamp). The dataframe for this can be seen in the output below.

/// tab | :fontawesome-brands-python: Python
```python
from raphtory import Graph
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("../data/lotr.csv")
print(df)

lotr_graph = Graph()
lotr_graph.load_edges_from_pandas(
    df=df,time="time", src="src", dst="dst"
)
