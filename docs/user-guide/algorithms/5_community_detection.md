# Community detection

One important feature of graphs is the degree of clustering and presence of community structures. Groups of nodes that have a high degree of connection between members of the group but comparatively few connections with the rest of the graph can be considered distinct communities.

Identifying clusters can be informative in social, biological and technological networks. For example, identifying clusters in web clients accessing a site can help optimise performance using a CDN or spotting changes in the communities amongst a baboon pack over time might inform theories about group dynamics. Raphtory provides a variety of algorithms to analyse community structures in your graphs.
