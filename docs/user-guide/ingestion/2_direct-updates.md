# Direct Updates

Now that we have a graph we can directly update it with the `add_node()` and `add_edge()` functions.

## Adding nodes

To add a node we need a unique `id` to represent it and an update `timestamp` to specify when it was added to the graph.
In the below example we are going to add node `10` at timestamp `1`.

!!! info

    If your data doesn't have any timestamps, you can just set a constant value, such as `1`, for all additions into the graph.  

/// tab | :fontawesome-brands-python: Python

```python
from raphtory import Graph

g = Graph()
v = g.add_node(timestamp=1, id=10)

print(g)
print(v)
```

///

```{.python continuation hide}
assert str(g) == "Graph(number_of_nodes=1, number_of_edges=0, number_of_temporal_edges=0, earliest_time=1, latest_time=1)"
assert str(v) == "Node(name=10, earliest_time=1, latest_time=1)"
```

Printing out the graph and the returned node we can see the update was successful and the earliest/latest time has been
updated.

!!! Output

    ```output
    Graph(number_of_nodes=1, number_of_edges=0, number_of_temporal_edges=0, earliest_time=1, latest_time=1)
    Node(name=10, earliest_time=1, latest_time=1)
    ```

## Adding edges

All graphs in raphtory are [directed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph), meaning edge additions must specify
a `timestamp` (the same as a `node_add()`), the `source` node the edge starts from and the `destination` node the edge
ends at.

In the example below we add an edge to the graph from `15` to `16` at timestamp `1`.

/// tab | :fontawesome-brands-python: Python

```python
from raphtory import Graph

g = Graph()
e = g.add_edge(timestamp=1, src=15, dst=16)

print(g)
print(e)
```

///

```{.python continuation hide}
assert str(g) == "Graph(number_of_nodes=2, number_of_edges=1, number_of_temporal_edges=1, earliest_time=1, latest_time=1)"
assert str(e) == "Edge(source=15, target=16, earliest_time=1, latest_time=1, layer(s)=[_default])"
```

!!! Output

    ```output
    Graph(number_of_nodes=2, number_of_edges=1, number_of_temporal_edges=1, earliest_time=1, latest_time=1)
    Edge(source=15, target=16, earliest_time=1, latest_time=1, layer(s)=[_default])
    ```

You will notice in the output that the graph has two nodes as well as the edge. Raphtory automatically creates the source and destination nodes at the same time if they do not currently exist in the graph. This is to keep the graph consistent and avoid `hanging edges`. These nodes are empty other than the history of their edges, therefore if you apply filters to exclude all edges these empty nodes will also be excluded from your graph.

## Accepted ID types

The `add_node()` and `add_edge()` functions will also accept strings for their `id`, `src` & `dst` arguments. This is
useful when your node IDs are not integers. For example, node IDs could be unique strings like a person's username or a
blockchain wallet hash.

In this example, we are adding two nodes to the graph `User 1` and `User 2` and an edge between them.

/// tab | :fontawesome-brands-python: Python

```python
from raphtory import Graph

g = Graph()

g.add_node(timestamp=123, id="User 1")
g.add_node(timestamp=456, id="User 2")
g.add_edge(timestamp=789, src="User 1", dst="User 2")

print(g.node("User 1"))
print(g.node("User 2"))
print(g.edge("User 1", "User 2"))
```

///

```{.python continuation hide}
assert str(g.node("User 1")) == "Node(name=User 1, earliest_time=123, latest_time=789)"
assert str(g.node("User 2")) == "Node(name=User 2, earliest_time=456, latest_time=789)"
assert str(g.edge("User 1", "User 2")) == "Edge(source=User 1, target=User 2, earliest_time=789, latest_time=789, layer(s)=[_default])"
```

!!! Output

    ```output
    Node(name=User 1, earliest_time=123, latest_time=789)
    Node(name=User 2, earliest_time=456, latest_time=789)
    Edge(source=User 1, target=User 2, earliest_time=789, latest_time=789, layer(s)=[_default])
    ```

!!! warning

    A graph can index nodes by either integers or strings, not both at the same time.This means, for example, you cannot
    have `User 1` (a string) and `200` (an integer) as ids in the same graph.

## Accepted timestamps

While integer based timestamps can represent both [logical time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_clock)
and [epoch time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time), datasets often have their timestamps stored in human readable
formats or special datetime objects. As such, `add_node()` and `add_edge()` can accept integers, datetime strings and
datetime objects interchangeably.

In the example below the node `10` is added into the graph at `2021-02-03 14:01:00` and `2021-01-01 12:32:00`. The first
timestamp is kept as a string, with Raphtory internally handling the conversion, and the second has been converted into
a python datetime object before ingestion. This datetime object can also have a timezone, with Raphtory storing
everything internally in UTC.

/// tab | :fontawesome-brands-python: Python

```python
from raphtory import Graph
from datetime import datetime

g = Graph()
g.add_node(timestamp="2021-02-03 14:01:00", id=10)

# Create a python datetime object
datetime_obj = datetime(2021, 1, 1, 12, 32, 0, 0)
g.add_node(timestamp=datetime_obj, id=10)

print(g)
print(g.node(id=10).history())
print(g.node(id=10).history_date_time())
```

///

```{.python continuation hide}
assert str(g) == "Graph(number_of_nodes=1, number_of_edges=0, number_of_temporal_edges=0, earliest_time=1609504320000, latest_time=1612360860000)"
assert str(g.node(id=10).history()) == "[1609504320000 1612360860000]"
assert str(g.node(id=10).history_date_time()) == "[datetime.datetime(2021, 1, 1, 12, 32, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc), datetime.datetime(2021, 2, 3, 14, 1, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc)]"
```

!!! Output

    ```output
    Graph(number_of_nodes=1, number_of_edges=0, number_of_temporal_edges=0, earliest_time=1609504320000, latest_time=1612360860000)
    [1609504320000 1612360860000]
    [datetime.datetime(2021, 1, 1, 12, 32, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc), datetime.datetime(2021, 2, 3, 14, 1, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc)]
    ```

In the output we can see the `history` of node `10` contains the two times at which we have added it into the graph (
maintained in ascending order), returned in both unix epoch (integer) and datetime format.

## Properties

Alongside the structural update history, Raphtory can maintain the changing value of [`Properties`][raphtory.Properties] associated with nodes
and edges. Both the `add_node()` and `add_edge()` functions have an optional parameter `properties` which takes a
dictionary of key value pairs to be stored at the given timestamp.

The graph itself may also have its own `global properties` added using the `add_properties()` function which takes only
a `timestamp` and a `properties` dictionary.

Properties can consist of primitives (`Integer`, `Float`, `String`, `Boolean`, `Datetime`) and structures (`Dictionary`,
`List`). This allows you to store both basic values as well as do complex hierarchical modelling depending on your use
case.

In the example below, we are using all of these functions to add a mixture of properties to a node, an edge, and the
graph.

!!! warning

    Please note that once a `property key` is associated with one of the above types for a given node/edge/graph, attempting
    to add a value of a different type under the same key will result in an error. For `Lists` the values must all be the
    same type and for `Dictionaries` the values for each key must always be the same type.

/// tab | :fontawesome-brands-python: Python

```python
from raphtory import Graph
from datetime import datetime

g = Graph()

# Primitive type properties added to a node
g.add_node(
    timestamp=1,
    id="User 1",
    properties={"count": 1, "greeting": "hi", "encrypted": True},
)
g.add_node(
    timestamp=2,
    id="User 1",

    id="User 1",
    properties={"balance": 0.9, "greeting": "hello", "encrypted": True},
)

# Dictionaries and Lists added to a graph

```

///

```{.python continuation hide}
assert str(e) == "Edge(source=User 1, target=User 2, earliest_time=4, latest_time=4, properties={weights: [1, 2, 3]}, layer(s)=[_default])"
```

!!! Output

    Edge(source=User 1, target=User 2, earliest_time=4, latest_time=4, properties={weights: [1, 2, 3]}, layer(s)=[_default])
    ```

!!! info

    When the output is printed only the latest property values are shown. The older values haven't been lost, in fact the
    history of all of these different property types can be queried, explored and aggregated, as you will see
    in [Property Queries](../querying/5_properties.md).

## Metadata

Raphtory also provides [`metadata`][raphtory.Metadata] associated with nodes and edges which have immutable values. These are useful when you know a value won't change or is not  associated with a specific time. 

You can use the `add_metadata()` function, which takes a single `dictionary` argument, to add metadata to a `graph`, `node` and `edge` as demonstrated below.

/// tab | :fontawesome-brands-python: Python

```python
from raphtory import Graph
from datetime import datetime

g = Graph()
v = g.add_node(timestamp=1, id="User 1")
e = g.add_edge(timestamp=2, src="User 1", dst="User 2")

g.add_metadata(metadata={"name": "Example Graph"})
v.add_metadata(
    metadata={"date of birth": datetime.strptime("1990-02-03", "%Y-%m-%d")},
)
e.add_metadata(metadata={"data source": "https://link-to-repo.com"})

print(g)
print(v)
print(e)
```

///

```{.python continuation hide}
assert str(g) == "Graph(number_of_nodes=2, number_of_edges=1, number_of_temporal_edges=1, earliest_time=1, latest_time=2)"
assert str(v) == "Node(name=User 1, earliest_time=1, latest_time=2)"
assert str(e) == "Edge(source=User 1, target=User 2, earliest_time=2, latest_time=2, layer(s)=[_default])"
```

!!! output

    ```output
    Graph(number_of_nodes=2, number_of_edges=1, number_of_temporal_edges=1, earliest_time=1, latest_time=2)
    Node(name=User 1, earliest_time=1, latest_time=2)
    Edge(source=User 1, target=User 2, earliest_time=2, latest_time=2, layer(s)=[_default])
    ```    

## Edge Layers

If you have worked with other graph libraries you may be expecting two calls to `add_edge()` between the same nodes to
generate two distinct edge objects. In Raphtory, these calls append the information together into the history of a
single edge.

Edges can be [exploded](../querying/4_edge-metrics.md/#exploded-edges) to interact with all updates independently and
Raphtory also allows you to represent totally different relationships between the same nodes via `edge layers`.

The `add_edge()` function takes a second optional parameter, `layer` that allows you to name the type of relationship
being added. All calls to `add_edge` with the same `layer` value will be stored together allowing them to be accessed
separately or merged with other layers as required.

You can see this in the example below where we add five updates between `Person 1` and `Person 2` across the layers
`Friends`, `Co Workers` and `Family`. When we query the history of the `weight` property on the edge we initially get
all of the values back. However, by applying the [`layers()` GraphView](../views/3_layer.md) we can return only updates
from `Co Workers` and `Family`.

/// tab | :fontawesome-brands-python: Python

    timestamp=1,
