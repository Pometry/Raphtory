# Introduction to GraphQL

[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)  is a query language for your API, and a server-side runtime for executing queries using a type system you define for your data. Using GraphQL can help you can reduce over-fetching and under-fetching of data compared to other REST APIs.

It is possible to query Raphtory graphs in GraphQL. The GraphQL server provides an IDE available at `localhost:1736/playground` where you can write GraphQL queries. Alternatively, you can write all your GraphQL queries in Python and easily update, send and receive Raphtory graphs from the GraphQL server.

This section will show you how to start a GraphQL server and run your own queries on your data.
