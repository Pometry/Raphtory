# Writing Raphtory queries in GraphQL

When you start a GraphQL server, you can find your GraphQL UI in the browser at `localhost:1736/playground` or an alternative port if you specified one.

The schema for the queries can be found on the right hand side in a pull out toggle.

## Example Queries in GraphQL

Here are some example queries to get you started:

### List of all the nodes

=== "![GraphQL](https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/15/graphql.png) GraphQL"

    ```
    query {
        graph(path: "your_graph") {
            nodes {
                list {
                    name
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

## List of all the edges, with specific node properties 

To find nodes with `age`:

=== "![GraphQL](https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/15/graphql.png) GraphQL"

    ```
    query {
        graph(path: "your_graph") {
            edges {
                list {
                    src {
                        name
                        properties {
                            get(key:"age") {
                                value
                            }
                        }
                    }
                    dst {
                        name
                        properties {
                            get(key:"age") {
                                value
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

This will return something like this:

!!! Output

    ```json
    {
    "data": {
        "graph": {
        "edges": {
            "list": [
            {
                "src": {
                "name": "Ben",
                "properties": {
                    "get": {
                    "value": 30
                    }
                }
                },
                "dst": {
                "name": "Hamza",
                "properties": {
                    "get": {
                    "value": 30
                    }
                }
                }
            },
            ]
        }
        }
    }
    }
    ```

All the queries that can be done in Python can also be done in GraphQL.

Here is an example:

=== ":fontawesome-brands-python: Python"

    ``` python
    g.node("Ben").properties.get("age")

    ```

=== "![GraphQL](https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/15/graphql.png) GraphQL"

    ``` graphql
    query {
        graph(path: "your_graph") {
            node(name: "Ben") {
                properties {
                    get(key: "age") {
                        value
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

## Querying GraphQL in Python

It is possible to send GraphQL queries in Python without the in-browser IDE. This can be useful if you want to update your Raphtory graph in Python. This example shows you how to do this with the Raphtory client:

=== ":fontawesome-brands-python: Python"

    ```python
    with GraphServer(work_dir).start():
        client = RaphtoryClient("http://localhost:1736")

        query = """{graph(path: "graph") { created lastOpened lastUpdated }}"""
        result = client.query(query)
    ```

Pass your graph object string into the `client.query()` method to execute the GraphQL query and retrieve the result in a python dictionary object.

=== ":fontawesome-brands-python: Python"

    ```python
    {'graph': {'created': 1729075008085, 'lastOpened': 1729075036222, 'lastUpdated': 1729075008085}}
    ```

## Mutation Queries

In GraphQL, you can write two different types of queries - a query to search through your data or a query that mutates your data.

The examples in the previous section are all queries used to search through your data. However in our API, you can also mutate your graph. This can be done both in the GraphQL IDE and in Python.

The schema in the GraphQL IDE shows how you can mutate the graph within the IDE:

```
type MutRoot {
  plugins: MutationPlugin!
  deleteGraph(path: String!): Boolean!
  newGraph(path: String!, graphType: GqlGraphType!): Boolean!
  moveGraph(path: String!, newPath: String!): Boolean!
  copyGraph(path: String!, newPath: String!): Boolean!

  # Use GQL multipart upload to send new graphs to server
  #
  # Returns::
  # name of the new graph
  uploadGraph(path: String!, graph: Upload!, overwrite: Boolean!): String!

  # Send graph bincode as base64 encoded string
  #
  # Returns::
  # path of the new graph
  sendGraph(path: String!, graph: String!, overwrite: Boolean!): String!
}
```

There are additional methods to mutate the graph exclusive to Python such as sending, receiving and updating a graph, these will all be explained below.

## Sending a graph

You can send a graph to the server and overwrite an existing graph if needed.

=== ":fontawesome-brands-python: Python"

    ```python
    tmp_work_dir = tempfile.mkdtemp()
    with GraphServer(tmp_work_dir).start():
        client = RaphtoryClient("http://localhost:1736")

        g = Graph()
        g.add_edge(1, "bob", "emma")
        g.add_edge(2, "sally", "tony")
        client.send_graph(path="g", graph=g, overwrite=True)
    ```

To check your query:

=== ":fontawesome-brands-python: Python"

    ```python
    query = """{graph(path: "g") {nodes {list {name}}}}"""
    client.query(query)
    ```

This should return:

!!! Output

    ```json
    {
        "graph": {
            "nodes": {
                "list": [
                    {"name": "bob"},
                    {"name": "emma"},
                    {"name": "sally"},
                    {"name": "tony"},
                ]
            }
        }
    }
    ```

## Receiving graphs

You can retrieve graphs from a "path" on the server which returns a Python Raphtory graph object.

=== ":fontawesome-brands-python: Python"

    ```python
    g = client.receive_graph("path/to/graph")
    g.edge("sally", "tony")
    ```

## Creating a new graph

This is an example of how to create a new graph in the server.

The first parameter is the path of the graph to be created and the second parameter is the type of graph that should be created, this will either be _EVENT_ or _PERSISTENT_.
An explanation of the different types of graph can be found [here](../../user-guide/persistent-graph/1_intro.md)

=== "![GraphQL](https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/15/graphql.png) GraphQL"

    ```graphql
    mutation {
        newGraph(path: "new_graph", graphType: PERSISTENT)
    }
    ```

=== ":fontawesome-brands-python: Python"

    ```python
    work_dir = tempfile.mkdtemp()
    with GraphServer(work_dir).start():
        client = RaphtoryClient("http://localhost:1736")
        client.new_graph("path/to/new_graph", "EVENT")
    ```

The returning result to confirm that a new graph has been created:

!!! Output

    ```json
    {
    "data": {
        "newGraph": true
    }
    }
    ```

## Moving a graph

It is possible to move a graph to a new path on the server.

=== "![GraphQL](https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/15/graphql.png) GraphQL"

    ```graphql
    mutation {
        moveGraph(path: "graph", newPath: "new_path")
    }
    ```

=== ":fontawesome-brands-python: Python"

    ```python
    work_dir = tempfile.mkdtemp()
    with GraphServer(work_dir).start():
        client = RaphtoryClient("http://localhost:1736")
        client.move_graph("path/to/graph", "path/to/new_path)
    ```

The returning GraphQL result to confirm that the graph has been moved:

!!! Output

    ```json
    {
    "data": {
        "moveGraph": true
    }
    }
    ```

## Copying a graph

It is possible to copy a graph to a new path on the server.

=== "![GraphQL](https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/15/graphql.png) GraphQL"

    ```graphql
    mutation {
        copyGraph(path: "graph", newPath: "new_path")
    }
    ```

=== ":fontawesome-brands-python: Python"

    ```python
    work_dir = tempfile.mkdtemp()
    with GraphServer(work_dir).start():
        client = RaphtoryClient("http://localhost:1736")
        client.copy_graph("path/to/graph", "path/to/new_path)
    ```

The returning GraphQL result to confirm that the graph has been copied:

!!! Output

    ```json
    {
    "data": {
        "copyGraph": true
    }
    }
    ```

## Deleting a graph

It is possible to delete a graph on the server.

=== "![GraphQL](https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/15/graphql.png) GraphQL"

    ```graphql
    mutation {
        deleteGraph(path: "graph")
    }
    ```

=== ":fontawesome-brands-python: Python"

    ```python
    work_dir = tempfile.mkdtemp()
    with GraphServer(work_dir).start():
        client = RaphtoryClient("http://localhost:1736")
        client.delete_graph("graph")
    ```

The returning GraphQL result to confirm that the graph has been deleted:

!!! Output

    ```json
    {
    "data": {
        "deleteGraph": true
    }
    }
    ```

## Updating the graph

It is possible to update the graph using the `remote_graph()` method.
=== ":fontawesome-brands-python: Python"

    ```python
    work_dir = tempfile.mkdtemp()
        with GraphServer(work_dir).start():
            client = RaphtoryClient("http://localhost:1736")
            client.new_graph("path/to/event_graph", "EVENT")
            rg = client.remote_graph("path/to/event_graph")
            rg.add_edge(1, "sally", "tony", layer="friendship")
    ```

Once you have updated the graph, for example by adding an edge, you can receive a graph by using `receive_graph()` and specifying the path of the graph you would like to receive.

=== ":fontawesome-brands-python: Python"

    ```python
    g = client.receive_graph("path/to/event_graph")
    ```
