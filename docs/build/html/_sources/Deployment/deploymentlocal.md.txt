# Bare Metal Cluster Deployment

**THIS TUTORIAL IS CURRENTLY OUT OF DATE, BUT WILL BE UPDATED SOON*

Here we will describe how to deploy Raphtory onto a distributed cluster. 

## Running Each Component
Once you have your Service and machines defined and set up, you can run each service with the example commands below. Note that we use args(0) in the `RaphtoryService` superclass to define which component is being deployed, so do not use this for anything else.

#### Leader

```bash
scala -classpath raphtory.jar:YOUR_CODE.jar the.path.to.your.service leader
```

#### Spout

```bash
scala -classpath raphtory.jar:YOUR_CODE.jar the.path.to.your.service spout
```

#### QueryManager 

```bash
scala -classpath raphtory.jar:YOUR_CODE.jar the.path.to.your.service analysisManager
```

#### GraphBuilder 

```bash
scala -classpath raphtory.jar:YOUR_CODE.jar the.path.to.your.service builder
```

#### ParitionManager

```bash
scala -classpath raphtory.jar:YOUR_CODE.jar the.path.to.your.service partitionManager
```

Once your services have been deployed, you should see exactly the same output when running in `RaphtoryGraph` mode. The head node should report that all components have come online and that you are ready to perform analysis.
