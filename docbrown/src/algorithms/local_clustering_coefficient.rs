//! Local Clustering coefficient - measures the degree to which nodes in a graph tend to cluster together.
//!
//! It is calculated by dividing the number of triangles (sets of three nodes that are all
//! connected to each other) in the graph by the total number of possible triangles.
//! The resulting value is a number between 0 and 1 that represents the density of
//! clustering in the graph.
//!
//! A high clustering coefficient indicates that nodes tend to be
//! connected to nodes that are themselves connected to each other, while a low clustering
//! coefficient indicates that nodes tend to be connected to nodes that are not connected
//! to each other.
//!
//! In a social network of a particular community, we can compute the clustering
//! coefficient of each node to get an idea of how strongly connected and cohesive
//! that node's neighborhood is.
//!
//! A high clustering coefficient for a node in a social network indicates that the
//! node's neighbors tend to be strongly connected with each other, forming a tightly-knit
//! group or community. In contrast, a low clustering coefficient for a node indicates that
//! its neighbors are relatively less connected with each other, suggesting a more fragmented
//! or diverse community.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```rust
//! use docbrown::algorithms::local_clustering_coefficient::{local_clustering_coefficient};
//! use docbrown::db::graph::Graph;
//! use docbrown::db::view_api::*;
//!
//! let g = Graph::new(1);
//! let windowed_graph = g.window(0, 7);
//! let vs = vec![
//!     (1, 1, 2),
//!     (2, 1, 3),
//!     (3, 2, 1),
//!     (4, 3, 2),
//!     (5, 1, 4),
//!     (6, 4, 5),
//! ];
//!
//! for (t, src, dst) in &vs {
//!     g.add_edge(*t, *src, *dst, &vec![], None);
//! }
//!
//! let actual = (1..=5)
//! .map(|v| local_clustering_coefficient(&windowed_graph, v))
//! .collect::<Vec<_>>();
//!
//! println!("local clustering coefficient of all nodes: {:?}", actual);
