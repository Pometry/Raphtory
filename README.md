Raphtory is an open-source platform for distributed real-time temporal graph analytics, allowing you to load and process large dynamic datsets across time. If you would like a brief summary of what its used for before fully diving into the getting started guide please check out this [article](https://www.turing.ac.uk/blog/just-add-time-dizzying-potential-dynamic-graphs) from the Alan Turing Institute first!

## 0.5.0 - Alpha
We are just putting the final touches to a brand new version of Raphtory which has been completely rebuilt to run on top of Apache Pulsar. This has fixed a number of issues faced in prior versions, notably around message back pressure, and introduces many exciting features including integration with Jupyter. If you would like to try this version prior to the full open source release the jar for this is available [here](https://github.com/Raphtory/Raphtory/releases/tag/0.5.0-alpha) and new documentation is available on [ReadTheDocs](https://raphtory.readthedocs.io/).

## Getting Started
The best way to get started with Raphtory is to vist our [website](https://raphtory.github.io/) where we have tutorials on how to use Raphtory for graph building, analysis, and more. Good entry points for this are:

- [Installation](https://raphtory.github.io/documentation/install)
- [Building a graph from your data](https://raphtory.github.io/documentation/sprouter)
- [Writing algorithms in Raphtory](https://raphtory.github.io/documentation/analysis-explained)
- [Six Degrees of Gandalf](https://raphtory.github.io/documentation/analysis-qs)
- [How to Deploy Raphtory - as a Graph and as a Service](https://raphtory.github.io/documentation/deployment)

We also have a [page](https://raphtory.github.io/algorithms/) for algorithms implemented in Raphtory (both temporal and static). These can be used to analyse your own datasets once ingested or as a basis to implement your own custom algorithms.


### Too Long Didn't Read - Let me run it now!
If you want to see how Raphtory runs without reading a mountain of documentation you can quickly get set up with an example Raphtory project via these steps:

1. Clone the [example](https://github.com/Raphtory/Examples) repo and pick one of the examples inside that takes your fancy. 
2. Download the [latest stable release](https://github.com/Raphtory/Raphtory/releases) of the Raphtory JAR, renaming it to`raphtory.jar`. Create a `lib` directory at the root of your chosen example project and move the `jar` to `lib`.
   * **Here be dragons:** You can also pick the nightly build, but there may be some quirks yet to be ironed out. If you find any please report the issue on [Jira](https://raphtory.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/RAPH/issues/) or on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/raphtory/shared_invite/zt-xbebws9j-VgPIFRleJFJBwmpf81tvxA).
3. Install SBT by following their [guide](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Setup.html). The example project uses SBT to compile the source code. 
4. Initiate SBT by changing into the example project directory in the terminal and running the command `sbt`. You will know when the SBT interactive shell has started once it shows `>`.
5. Execute `compile` to build the project. 
6. Execute `run` to start the project. You will then see Raphtory build the graph and execute an algorithm relevant to your chosen dataset.
7. The rest is then up to you - feel free to explore the data, submit different algorithms and ask any questsions you have on the Raphtory [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/raphtory/shared_invite/zt-xbebws9j-VgPIFRleJFJBwmpf81tvxA)!   
8. Run analysis over your algorithms running different queries - [`Point Query`, `Range Query` and `Live Query`](https://raphtory.github.io/documentation/analysis-qs)

**Note:** Raphtory is built with Scala. We recommend using IntelliJ IDE for your code. They have a community version which is free. Follow their [guide](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows) for installation.

### Conventional Commits
Raphtory is now **commitizen friendly** which means our commit history is now be dictated by [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) conventions. To add and enforce this convention in our development workflow we are using npm tool called [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli). In practise, what it means is that we need to have `commitizen` installed on our dev machines as external dev dependency before we could start making contributions.

1. Install nodejs (refer [documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/download/))
2. Install [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli)
   ```
   $ npm install -g commitizen
   ```
3. Install [commitizen adapter](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli#adapters)
   ```
   $ npm install -g cz-conventional-changelog
   $ echo '{ "path": "cz-conventional-changelog" }' > ~/.czrc
   ```
4. Run `sbt`. This will copy necessary custom hooks from `git-hooks` to `.git/hooks`

You're good to start making contributions. `git commit` should present you now with a serious of questions, answers to which will result in conventional commit.
