Raphtory is a unified analytics engine for large-scale graph analysis, allowing you to run complex graph queries no matter where your data lives and what format it is in. Besides performance and scalability, what makes Raphtory cool is its ability to represent and explore the history of a complex system, from simply ‚Äútime travelling‚Äù through data, to executing richer analysis like **taint tracking**, **temporal reachability**, or **mining temporal motifs**.

**Raphtory is easy to use:** One-line pip installation and smooth integration with Pandas for input and output.

**Raphtory is expressive:** Designed to represent all types of graph queries and temporal graphs in mind, with a thoughtfully developed API for exploring your data across its history.

**Raphtory is scalable:** Built on top of Apache Arrow‚Äôs storage model and gRPC for client communication, Raphtory can be run on a laptop or scaled up to a cluster for results on terabyte scale graphs.

# Running a basic example

```python
#¬†Import Raphtory
import PyRaphtory

#¬†Create a new local or distributed context
ctx = PyRaphtory.local()
graph = ctx.new_graph()

# Add some data to your graph
graph.add_vertex(1, 1)
graph.add_vertex(2, 2)
graph.add_vertex(3, 3)
graph.add_edge(4, 1, 2)
graph.add_edge(4, 1, 3)

# Collect some simple vertex metrics
#¬†Ran across a range of the data with incremental windowing
df = graph
      .range(1,4,1)
      .window(1)
      .select(lambda vertex: Row(vertex.name(), vertex.out_degree(), vertex.in_degree()))
      .to_df(["name", "out_degree", "in_degree"])

# Preview DataFrame
df

|    |   timestamp |   window |   name |   out_degree |   in_degree |
|---:|------------:|---------:|-------:|-------------:|------------:|
|  0 |           1 |        1 |      1 |            0 |           0 |
|  1 |           2 |        1 |      2 |            0 |           0 |
|  2 |           3 |        1 |      3 |            0 |           0 |
|  3 |           4 |        1 |      1 |            2 |           0 |
|  4 |           4 |        1 |      2 |            0 |           1 |
|  5 |           4 |        1 |      3 |            0 |           1 |

You can try out Raphtory for yourself in a Jupyter Notebook. Please click here [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Raphtory/Raphtory/v0.2.0a9?labpath=examples%2Fbinder_python%2Findex.ipynb) to launch the notebook.

# Installing Raphtory 
Raphtory is available for both Python and Scala / Java, with support for Rust planned in the 0.3.0 release. 

We recommend installing the PyRaphtory client for Python, which contains all the functions to create a graph, run algorithms and analyse results. We also support Conda, but pip is the preferred option.

Make sure you have **Python v3.9 or above**. It is also recommended that you install Raphtory through conda, virtualenv or pyenv as a best practice. 

```bash
pip install pyraphtory_jvm pyraphtory
```

# Bounty board

We are currently running a bounty board for anyone that wishes to contribute to Raphtory, whether it be cool features or yet to be implemented algorithms.

All contributors receive swag and small prizes!

To get you started, we currently have a list of algorithms that we would like to build into Raphtory. With a number of üçá low hanging fruit ones. Make sure to check it out at https://www.raphtory.com/algorithm-bounty/
