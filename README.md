Raphtory is a unified analytics engine for **distributed graph analytics**, which allows you to run complex graph queries **no matter where your data lives** and **what format** it is in. What makes Raphtory unique is its combination of a **graph model with time-series analysis**, providing a powerful model for extracting new **insights**. Raphtory supports both **traditional graph analysis** (e.g. shortest path and community detection), as well as **trend and anomaly detection** via time-series. Things get interesting when the two are combined, allowing you to **"time travel"** through your data, look for **time-respecting paths**, identify **causal relationships**, model the evolution of **communities over time** or extract **temporal patterns in the interactions** between entities in the network.

Features of Raphtory include:
1. **No data movement** required, read your data as a graph no matter storage and format
2. Easy to install and run, with functions familiar to **NetworkX** and easy integration with **Pandas**
3. **Performant and scalable**, with Apache Arrow storage model and gRPC client communication

# Prerequisites
- Python 3.9.15
  - Conda, virtualenv or system installed Python
- Mac and Linux

# Install

Install PyRaphtory, which contains all the functions to create a graph, run algorithms and analyse results. We also support Conda, but pip is the preferred option.

*Make sure Python version > 3.7 is installed.*

```bash
pip install requests pandas pemja cloudpickle parsy
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ pyraphtory_jvm==0.2.0a7
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ pyraphtory==0.2.0a7
```

# Basic Example

Initialise Raphtory and create a new graph.
```python
import PyRaphtory

ctx = PyRaphtory.local()
graph = ctx.new_graph()
```

Add nodes and edges to your graph from any file (here we used a CSV file).
```python
graph.add_vertex(1, 1)
graph.add_vertex(2, 2)
graph.add_vertex(3, 3)
graph.add_edge(4, 1, 2)
graph.add_edge(4, 1, 3)
```
Collect simple metrics from your graph.
```python
df = graph
      .range(1,4,1)
      .window(1)
      .select(lambda vertex: Row(vertex.name(), vertex.out_degree(), vertex.in_degree()))
      .to_df(["name", "out_degree", "in_degree"])
```
Check out the output.
```python
df
```
|    |   timestamp |   window |   name |   out_degree |   in_degree |
|---:|------------:|---------:|-------:|-------------:|------------:|
|  0 |           1 |        1 |      1 |            0 |           0 |
|  1 |           2 |        1 |      2 |            0 |           0 |
|  2 |           3 |        1 |      3 |            0 |           0 |
|  3 |           4 |        1 |      1 |            2 |           0 |
|  4 |           4 |        1 |      2 |            0 |           1 |
|  5 |           4 |        1 |      3 |            0 |           1 |
