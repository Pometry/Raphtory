Raphtory is a powerful analytics engine for large-scale graph analysis. It lets you run complex queries on your data, 
no matter where it's stored or what format it's in. But that's not all - Raphtory's real superpower is its ability to 
track and explore the history of a complex system, from "time traveling" through data to executing advanced analysis 
like taint tracking, temporal reachability, and mining temporal motifs.

**Raphtory is easy to use:** just run a single `pip install raphtory` command and embed it with your existing Python/Pandas pipeline for input and output.

**Raphtory is expressive:** It's designed to represent all types of graph queries and has a well-developed API for exploring your data across its history.

**Raphtory is lightning-fast and scales effortlessly**: Our core is built upon rust. Raphtory can be run on a laptop or a distributed cluster for terabyte-scale graphs.



# Running a basic example

```python
#¬†Import raphtory
from raphtory import Graph

#¬†Create a new local or distributed context
graph = Graph(1)

# Add some data to your graph
graph.add_vertex(1, 1)
graph.add_vertex(2, 2)
graph.add_vertex(3, 3)
graph.add_edge(4, 1, 2)
graph.add_edge(4, 1, 3)

# Collect some simple vertex metrics
#¬†Ran across a range of the data with incremental windowing
graph_set = graph.window(1,5).rolling(1)

results = [["timestamp", "window", "name", "out_degree", "in_degree"]]

for rolling_graph in graph_set:
    for v in rolling_graph.vertices():
        window = rolling_graph.end() - rolling_graph.start()
        results.append([rolling_graph.earliest_time(), window, v.name(), v.out_degree(), v.in_degree()])
    

# Preview DataFrame
pd.DataFrame(results[1:], columns=results[0])
```

```a

|    |   timestamp |   window |   name |   out_degree |   in_degree |
|----|-------------|----------|--------|--------------|-------------|
|  0 |           1 |        1 |      1 |            0 |           0 |
|  1 |           2 |        1 |      2 |            0 |           0 |
|  2 |           3 |        1 |      3 |            0 |           0 |
|  3 |           4 |        1 |      1 |            2 |           0 |
|  4 |           4 |        1 |      2 |            0 |           1 |
|  5 |           4 |        1 |      3 |            0 |           1 |
```

# Installing Raphtory 

Raphtory is available for Python and Rust as of version 0.3.0. We recommend using the raphtory client for Python, which includes everything you need and can be run locally or in distributed mode.

You should have Python version 3.9 or higher. It's a good idea to use conda, virtualenv, or pyenv. 

```bash
pip install raphtory
```
