Raphtory is an open-source platform for distributed real-time temporal graph analytics, allowing you to load and process large dynamic datasets across time. If you would like a brief summary of what its used for before fully diving into the getting started guide please check out this [article](https://www.turing.ac.uk/blog/just-add-time-dizzying-potential-dynamic-graphs) from the Alan Turing Institute! For more in-depth info you can watch our most recent talk on Raphtory at [AIUK 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S9Ymnih-YM&list=PLuD_SqLtxSdVEUsCYlb5XjWm9D6WuNKEz&index=9), [KGC 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37S4bSN5EaU) and [NetSciX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxhrONca4FE).

## 0.2.0a7 - Raphtory Pre-Alpha Release
With the release of 0.2.0, we have re-designed and updated many of the core components. The full changelog can be dug into [here](https://github.com/Raphtory/Raphtory/releases), but as a sneak peek this includes:

* ..... TBD 

The prior version of Raphtory has now been deprecated as raphtory-akka which will remain available with no support [here](https://github.com/Raphtory/Raphtory/tree/raphtory-akka).

# Getting Started
The best way to get started with Raphtory is to visit our [ReadTheDocs](https://raphtory.readthedocs.io/) site where we have tutorials on how to use Raphtory for graph building, analysis, and more. 

**Note:** Raphtory is built with Scala and works with Python. We recommend using IntelliJ IDE for your code. They have a community version which is free. Follow their [guide](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows) for installation.

### Good entry points for the very beginning are

- [Installation](https://docs.raphtory.com/en/development/Install/start.html) - Installation of Raphtory and PyRaphtory. 
- [Building a graph from your data](https://raphtory.readthedocs.io/en/development/Ingestion/sprouter.html) - How to ingest raw data into Raphtory and the basics of modelling your data as a Temporal Graph.
- [Six Degrees of Gandalf](https://raphtory.readthedocs.io/en/development/Analysis/LOTR_six_degrees.html) - A Lord of the Rings themed intro into the world of Graph Algorithms.
- [Running queries across time](https://raphtory.readthedocs.io/en/development/Analysis/queries.html) - Exploring how to run algorithms throughout the history of your data. 
- [Analysis In Raphtory](https://raphtory.readthedocs.io/en/development/Analysis/analysis-explained.html) - A deeper dive into the underlying analysis model of Raphtory. 

### Once you are feeling more comfortable with Raphtory you can checkout out
- [ScalaDocs](https://raphtory.readthedocs.io/en/development/Scaladoc/index.html), [PythonDocs](https://raphtory.readthedocs.io/en/development/PythonDocs/index.html) and [Algorithm API](https://raphtory.readthedocs.io/en/development/_autodoc/com/raphtory/algorithms/generic/index.html) - We provide a fully documented API for Raphtory, explaining all user-facing classes and functions. This sits alongside explanations for the included algorithmic library (both temporal and static). These algorithms can be used to analyse your datasets once ingested or as a basis to implement your own custom algorithms.
- [Raphtory Streaming and Distributed Deployment](https://raphtory.readthedocs.io/en/development/Deployment/pulsarlocal.html) - Raphtory can be deployed as a single node or a distributed cluster. For the latter, we provide runners to establish the cluster on bare metal or on top of Kubernetes. 
- [Using the Python client](https://raphtory.readthedocs.io/en/development/PythonClient/setup.html) - We are developing a full python client alongside the main scala implementation so that you can attach Raphtory to your favorite data science tools.
