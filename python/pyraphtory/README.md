# Getting started with `pyraphtory`

Pyraphtory is the new version of the Raphtory python API. It is in experimental stage, so everything might change.

At the core of this iteration is the `com.raphtory.python.PyRaphtory` class that is able to start a Raphtory instance
with python support or connect to an existing Raphtory Cluster.

## Installation

There are two ways to install PyRaphtory.

1. Conda - Using the autoinstaller (This will install java, scala, sbt, raphtory and pyraphtory)

2. Source - Will build everything from scratch.

# Developer notes

## Publishing to pypi with poetry

We must manually comment out (#) the `# include = ["lib/core-*.jar"]` line in the pyproject.toml
before  pushing to pypi, otherwise pypi will reject the library due to the jar being too large.

Note: You must change version name upon each push, to overwrites the previous version

### PyPi Production environment

#### First config poetry

    poetry config repositories.pypi https://pypi.org/

##### With dry run

`--dry-run` will not publish the package, it will just build the package locally

    poetry publish -r pypi -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD --dry-run

##### Without dry run

    poetry publish -r pypi -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD

### PyPi Test Environment

#### First config poetry

    poetry config repositories.testpypi https://test.pypi.org/legacy/

##### With dry run

`--dry-run` will not publish the package, it will just build the package locally

    poetry publish -r testpypi -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD --dry-run

##### Without dry run

    poetry publish -r testpypi -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD
