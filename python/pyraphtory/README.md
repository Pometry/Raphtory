# Getting started with `pyraphtory`

Pyraphtory is the new version of the Raphtory python API. It is in experimental stage, so everything might change.

At the core of this iteration is the `com.raphtory.python.PyRaphtory` class that is able to start a Raphtory instance
with python support or connect to an existing Raphtory Cluster.

## Installation

### Pre-requisites 

Raphtory has a dependency on [Apache Pulsar](https://pulsar.apache.org/).

Please download Apache Pulsar from the official website. 

This is required for both conda and from source

### Guide

There are two ways to install PyRaphtory.

A. Via [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/index.html) - This will install java, scala, sbt, raphtory and pyraphtory

or

B. From Source - Will build everything from scratch.

### A. Conda

#### Requirements 

- [Anaconda or Miniconda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) 

#### Instructions

Using Conda this guide will install java, scala, sbt, raphtory and pyraphtory into the conda environment

1. Create a conda environment, change ENV to an environment name of your choice
```bash
  conda create --name ENV python=3.9.13 -c conda-forge --strict-channel-priority
```

2. Activate this environment
```bash
  conda activate ENV
```

3. Run the installer
```bash
  conda install pyraphtory -c conda-forge
```

Note: If you want to build a specific branch or release of raphtory, 
you can change the build conda chooses by setting the environment variable `RAPHTORY_GIT_TAG`

This will set conda to build and install the `development` branch 

    export RAPHTORY_GIT_TAG=development

This will set conda to build and install a `feature` branch

    export RAPHTORY_GIT_TAG=feature/XYZ


### B. From Source

#### Requirements

- Temurin Java 11 - 11.0.16-tem
  - Please ensure `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is set and points to a JDK location
- scala 2.13
- sbt 1.5.5
- python 3.9.13
- make
- [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
- [Apache Pulsar](https://pulsar.apache.org/)

#### Instructions

1. Clone Raphtory `git clone https://github.com/Raphtory/Raphtory.git` and `cd` into the root
2. Build Raphtory via `make sbt-build`
3. Build and install pyraphtory via `make python-build`. This will install pyraphtory into your current python environment 

##  Running PyRaphtory

1. Start pulsar via `pulsar standalone`
2. (in a different shell) run pyraphtory examples



# Developer notes

## Publishing to pypi with poetry

We must manually comment out (#) the `# include = ["lib/core-*.jar"]` line in the pyproject.toml
before  pushing to pypi, otherwise pypi will reject the library due to the jar being too large.

Note: You must change version name upon each push, to overwrites the previous version

### PyPi Production environment

#### First config poetry

    poetry config repositories.pypi https://pypi.org/

##### With dry run

`--dry-run` will not publish the package, it will just build the package locally

    poetry publish -r pypi -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD --dry-run

##### Without dry run

    poetry publish -r pypi -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD

### PyPi Test Environment

#### First config poetry

    poetry config repositories.testpypi https://test.pypi.org/legacy/

##### With dry run

`--dry-run` will not publish the package, it will just build the package locally

    poetry publish -r testpypi -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD --dry-run

##### Without dry run

    poetry publish -r testpypi -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD
