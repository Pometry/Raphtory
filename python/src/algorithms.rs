///
/// For example, in a social network, the local triangle count of a user's profile can reveal the

/// Local triangle count can also be used in other domains such as biology, where it can be used
/// to analyze protein interaction networks, or in transportation networks, where it can be used
/// to identify critical junctions or potential traffic bottlenecks.
