 * The facebook dataset consists of 'circles' (or 'friends lists') from Facebook. Facebook data was collected from survey
 * participants using this Facebook app. The dataset includes node features (profiles), circles, and ego networks.
 * Facebook data has been anonymized by replacing the Facebook-internal ids for each user with a new value.
 * Also, while feature vectors from this dataset have been provided, the interpretation of those features
 * has been obscured. For instance, where the original dataset may have contained a feature "political=Democratic Party"
 * the new data would simply contain "political=anonymized feature 1". Thus, using the anonymized data it is possible
 * to determine whether two users have the same political affiliations, but not what their individual political
 *  affiliations represent.
 *
 * Dataset statistics
 * Nodes	4039
 * Edges	88234
 * Nodes in largest WCC	4039 (1.000)
 * Edges in largest WCC	88234 (1.000)
 * Nodes in largest SCC	4039 (1.000)
 * Edges in largest SCC	88234 (1.000)
 * Average clustering coefficient	0.6055
 * Number of triangles	1612010
 * Fraction of closed triangles	0.2647
 * Diameter (longest shortest path)	8
 * 90-percentile effective diameter	4.7

Note that these statistics were compiled by combining the ego-networks, including the ego nodes themselves
 *  (along with an edge to each of their friends).
