# Ethereum Taint Tracking

## Overview
This example runs a taint tracking algorithm on the subset of the Ethereum blockchain. 

## Project Overview

The `LocalRunner` initiates a FileSpout which reads the Ethereum data from a CSV file. 
The data is a `csv` file (comma-separated values) is located in the `resources` folder. 

Each line contains a transaction delimited via hash, block_hash, block_number, from_address, to_address, value and block_timestamp. 

* `LocalRunner.scala` runs the application including the analysis and outputs to Pulsar.
* `graphbuilder/EthereumGraphBuilder.scala` builds the graph.
* `Distributed.scala` runs the application with in a distributed cluster, tutorial coming soon!
* `Client.scala` connects to a cluster in order to send queries. 
* `analysis/TaintTracking.scala` holds a taint tracking algorithm which retails history.

Refer back to [Building a graph from your data](https://raphtory.readthedocs.io/en/development/Ingestion/sprouter.html#) for a more in-depth explanation on how these parts work to build your graph.

## IntelliJ setup guide

As of February 2022, this is a guide to run this within IntelliJ.

1. From https://adoptopenjdk.net/index.html download OpenJDK 11 (LTS) with the HotSpot VM.
2. Enable this as the project SDK under File > Project Structure > Project Settings > Project > Project SDK.
3. Create a new configuration as an `Application` , select Java 11 as the build, and `com.raphtory.examples.ethereum.LocalRunner` as the class, add the Environment Variables


## Running this example

1. This example project is up on Github: [raphtory-example-ethereum](https://github.com/Raphtory/Raphtory/tree/development/examples/raphtory-example-ethereum). Please install dependencies from [here](https://raphtory.readthedocs.io/en/development/Install/installdependencies.html).
2. Download the _transactions_09000000_09099999_small.csv.gz_ data from [raphtory-data](https://github.com/Raphtory/Data) repository and place it inside the 'data' folder.
2. Download the _etherscan_tags.csv_ data from [raphtory-data](https://github.com/Raphtory/Data) repository and place it inside the 'src/main/resources' folder.
3. In the Examples folder, open up the directory `raphtory-example-ethereum` to get this example running.
4. Install all the python libraries necessary for visualising your data via the [Jupyter Notebook Tutorial](https://raphtory.readthedocs.io/en/development/PythonClient/tutorial.html).
This example also requires Graphviz and Pygraphviz found [here](https://pygraphviz.github.io/documentation/stable/install.html). 
Once you have Jupyter Notebook up and running on your local machine, you can open up the Jupyter Notebook specific for this project, with all the commands needed to output your graph. This can be found by following the path `python/example.ipynb`.
5. Now you can copy the data from the data folder into `/tmp/data` 
6. You are now ready to run this example. You can either run this example via sbt by running `sbt run` followed by selecting the localrunnder class `com.raphtory.ethereum.LocalRunner` More details for sbt can be found [here](https://raphtory.readthedocs.io/en/development/Install/installdependencies.html#running-raphtory-via-sbt).
7. Once your job has finished, you are ready to go onto Jupyter Notebook and run your analyses/output.

The results will be saved to the topics `TaintTracking`, producing the following results

Taint Tracking sample dataframe which shows the following columns 
* runtime - time the algorithm was run
* infected - node that was infected
