/**
  * Description
  * This algorithm takes the Page Rank Score from the vertices neighbour's and multiplies
  * this by the vertices ranking from the original raw dataset (the vertex in degree). If the vertex gets a high MemberRank score,
  * this means that other people that have high Page Rank values have rated them highly. This should dampen
  * the effects of bots further.
