    "\n",
    "Similarity search isn't a novel concept. It's a powerful technique that sifts through a collection of documents to identify those bearing semantic resemblance to a given query.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a query like `hiding information`. Imagine applying this query across a corpus of email messages; the result would likely yield documents discussing various aspects of concealing information.\n",
    "\n",
    "And which role does that play in Raphtory land? To traverse the bridge, we must represent entities within graphs as documents or sets of documents. These documents are then transformed into embeddings or vectors using an embedding function for effective searchability. In Raphtory, this process is referred to as 'vectorising' a graph, and it is as easy as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "vg = g.vectorise(embeddding_function)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Raphtory has a default way to translate graph entities into documents. However, if we have a deep understanding of our graph's semantics, we can always create those documents ourselves, insert them as properties, and let Raphtory know which property name use to pick them up:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "g.add_vertex(0, 'Kenneth Lay', {'document': 'Kenneth Lay is the former CEO of Enron'})\n",
    "vg = g.vectorise(embeddding_function, nodes=\"document\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Voila! Executing a similarity search query on the graph is now straightforward. Using methods within `VectorisedGraph`, we can select and retrieve documents based on a query:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "vg.append_by_similarity('hiding information', limit=10).get_documents()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This example is a basic query, capturing the top 10 highest-scoring documents. However, Raphtory offers an array of advanced methods, enabling the implementation of complex similarity search algorithms. You can combine different queries into a single selection or even leverage the graph's space between documents to add more context to one selection using an similarity based expansion.\n",

    "And our `vectors` module comes into play at this stage. We are going to vectorise the graph we just built. As previously outlined, this involves employing an embedding function that translates documents into vectors. For this purpose, we've selected a local model from Langchain named `gte-small`. It's important to note that this operation is computationally very expensive. When initiated from scratch, the process can span several hours. However, to streamline this, the vectorising process enables the setup of a cache file. By utilizing this cache, embeddings for previously processed documents are readily available, avoiding the need to invoke the resource-intensive model repeatedly. Fortunately, we've already taken this step for you, and there already exists a file named `embedding-cache` in the current directory, containing all the necessary embeddings for today's task, so the execution will be instant"
