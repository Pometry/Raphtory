    "Our two options here are `local` and `remote`. As we are just testing it on our laptops we can use `local`, meaning the Raphtory code will run within your python process. We will dig into `remote` contexts later when you want to deploy in a seperate process or scale your graph past what your laptop can handle.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "Once a graph is created, we need to add some data to it if we want run anything interesting. There are loads of ways of doing this in Raphtory, which we will cover in the next section, but for simplicity lets just add some vertices and edges without any properties. \n",
    "\n",
    "As Raphtory is focused on dynamic and temporal analysis, all events in the graph's history  (adding, updating or deleting nodes/edges) must happen at a given time. This can all be at the same time (if, for example, you are working with snapshots) but we still need a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, when we add a vertex we have two arguments: the `timestamp` and the `vertex ID`. Simiarly, when adding an edge, we have three arguments: the `timestamp`, the `source vertex` and the `destination vertex`. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** All graphs are directed by default in Raphtory, but can be `projected` into an undirected graph - we will go indepth into graph projections later in the tutorial.   \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code block we have five updates for our graph, adding three vertices (`1`,`2`,`3`) at time `1` and two edges (`1->2`, `1->3`) at time `2` . \n",

From this point we can either write our results to a `Sink` (file, database, etc.), which we will cover later in the tutorial, or convert it into a dataframe for further analysis.\n",

    "One aspect which is notable here is that we requested three variables, but we have five columns. This is because algorithms in Raphtory run at set points in time, meaning the values for each vertex must be associated with a `timestamp` (in this case the most recent one `2`). \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes when we are running queries we may also apply a `window`, which filters updates outside a given bound into the past or future. We, therefore, also have a column to specify if one has been applied. As we didn't do any of that here, the `window` column states `None`. \n",
