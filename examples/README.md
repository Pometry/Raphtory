Raphtory is an open-source platform for distributed real-time temporal graph analytics, allowing you to load and process large dynamic datsets across time. If you would like a brief summary of what its used for before fully diving into the getting start guide please check out this [article](https://www.turing.ac.uk/blog/just-add-time-dizzying-potential-dynamic-graphs) from the Alan Turing Institute first!

## Getting Started
The best way to get started with Raphtory is to vist our [website](https://raphtory.github.io/) where we have tutorials on how to use Raphtory for graph building, analysis, and more. Good entry points for this are:

- [Installation](https://raphtory.github.io/documentation/install)
- [Building a graph from your data](https://raphtory.github.io/documentation/sprouter)
- [Writing algorithms in Raphtory](https://raphtory.github.io/documentation/analysis-explained)
- [Six Degrees of Gandalf](https://raphtory.github.io/documentation/analysis-qs)
- [How to Deploy Raphtory](https://raphtory.github.io/documentation/deployment)

We also have a [page](https://raphtory.github.io/algorithms/) for algorithms implemented in Raphtory (both temporal and static). These can be used to analyse your own datasets once ingested or as a basis to implement your own custom algorithms.


### Too Long Didn't Read - Let me run it now!
If you want to see how Raphtory runs without reading a mountain of documentation you can quickly get set up with an example Raphtory project via these steps:

1. Clone the [example](https://github.com/Raphtory/Examples) repo and pick one of the examples inside that takes your fancy. 
2. Download the [latest stable release](https://github.com/Raphtory/Raphtory/releases) of the `raphtory.jar` and move it into the lib directory of your chosen example project. 
   * **Here be dragons:** You can also pick the nightly build, but there may be some quirks yet to be ironed out. If you find any please report the issue on [Jira](https://raphtory.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/RAPH/issues/) or on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/raphtory/shared_invite/zt-xbebws9j-VgPIFRleJFJBwmpf81tvxA).
3. Install SBT by following their [guide](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Setup.html). The example project uses SBT to compile the source code. 
4. Initiate SBT by changing into the example project directory in the terminal and running the command `sbt`. You will know when the SBT interactive shell has started once it shows `>`.
5. Execute `compile` to build the project. 
6. Execute `run` to start the project. You will then see Raphtory build the graph and execute an algorithm relevant to your chosen dataset.
7. The rest is then up to you - feel free to explore the data, submit different algorithms and ask any questsions you have on the Raphtory [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/raphtory/shared_invite/zt-xbebws9j-VgPIFRleJFJBwmpf81tvxA)!   

**Note:** Raphtory is built with Scala. We recommend using IntelliJ IDE for your code. They have a community version which is free. Follow their [guide](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows) for installation.
