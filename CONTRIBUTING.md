## Build Raphtory

### Python Packages
Raphtory python comes as two packages `pyraphtory_jvm` and `pyraphtory`. 

Lets see how we can build these packages.

- Ensure python build dependencies are installed
    ```bash
    $ python -m pip install poetry
    ```

- Build packages
    ```bash
    $ make python-build
    ```

### Build Jar

- Build all jars
    ```bash
    $ cd Raphtory
    $ make sbt-build 
    ```

## Run Tests

### Python Tests

- Ensure test dependencies are installed
    ```bash
    $ python -m pip install nbmake tox pytest-xdist
    ```

- To run `pyraphtory` JVM tests
    ```bash
    $ cd python/pyraphtory_jvm && tox -p -o
    ```

- To run `pyraphtory` tests
    ```bash
    $ cd python/pyraphtory && poetry run pytest -n=auto
    ```

- To run notebook tests
    ```bash
    $ cd examples && pytest --nbmake -n=auto
    ```

- To run documentation notebook tests
    ```bash
    $ cd docs && pytest --nbmake -n=auto
    ```

### Scala Tests
Going by maven conventions, unit and integration tests are defined in `src/test` and `src/it` directories for any module, respectively.

Common test classes are defined in `testkit` module.

- To run tests across all modules
    ```bash
    sbt:Raphtory> test     # Runs all unit tests
    sbt:Raphtory> it:test  # Runs all integration tests
    ```
- To run tests for a module (for example)
    ```bash
    sbt:Raphtory> project it
    sbt:it> test     # Runs all unit tests
    sbt:it> it:test  # Runs all integration tests
    ```

## Update Docs
Raphtory documentations can be found in `docs` directory. They are built using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/).

After making your changes, you're good to build them. 

- Ensure that all developement dependencies are already installed.
    ```bash
    $ pip install \
        ipykernel \
        autodoc \
        myst-parser \
        sphinx-rtd-theme \
        sphinx \
        docutils \
        sphinx-tabs \
        nbsphinx
    ```

- Build Raphtory
    ```bash
    $ cd Raphtory
    $ make sbt-build
    $ make python-build
    ```

- Build docs
    ```bash
    $ cd docs
    $ make html
    ```

- View docs
    ```bash
    $ open build/html/index.html
    ```
  
    **Note**: If you're not editing Scaladocs, you can disabled building Scaladocs to greatly speed up build times. Just set following flags to `False` in `docs/source/conf.py`:

    ```bash
    build_scaladocs = True
    build_algodocs = True
    ```
